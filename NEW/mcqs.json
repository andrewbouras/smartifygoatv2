      "Because they do not form a corpus luteum",
      "Because they have increased estrogen levels",
      "Because they have a shorter luteal phase",
      "Because they have higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)"
    ],
    "correct_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Women with anovulation do not form a corpus luteum, which is responsible for producing progesterone. Without the corpus luteum, progesterone levels decrease.",

    "question": "What is the transformation zone of the cervix?",
    "options": [
      "The squamocolumnar junction between the ectocervix and endocervix",

      "The region where the uterus connects to the fallopian tubes",

    ],
    "correct_index": 0,
    "explanation": "The transformation zone of the cervix is specifically the squamocolumnar junction between the ectocervix and endocervix. This area is significant because it is where the type of epithelial cells changes, making it a common site for abnormalities and cervical cancer.",

    "options": [
      "Injection of an alpha-1 agonist, such as phenylephrine, into the erectile tissue",

      "Application of a cold compress to the affected area",

    ],
    "correct_index": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct treatment for priapism involves the injection of an alpha-1 agonist, such as phenylephrine, into the erectile tissue. This helps to constrict blood vessels and reduce the prolonged erection. Other options, such as oral beta-blockers, cold compresses, or surgical removal, are not appropriate treatments for this condition.",

    "correct_index": 1,
    "explanation": "A ruptured ovarian cyst typically presents as sudden, sharp pain in an adnexa and is treated symptomatically, which may include pain relief and monitoring. Antibiotics, surgery, and hormonal therapy are not the primary treatments for this condition.",
