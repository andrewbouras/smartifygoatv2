  "factoids": "- The A-band does not change length during muscle contraction.\n- During muscle contraction, the H-zone, I-band, and sarcomere (Z-Z) shorten.\n- Tropomyosin is a protein on actin that covers myosin binding sites.\n- Calcium binds to troponin during muscle contraction, causing a conformational change that releases tropomyosin from actin.\n- ATP is required to relax muscle.\n- Rigor mortis occurs in the deceased due to decreased ATP.\n- The A-band does not change length during muscle contraction, while the I-band, H-zone, and length of the sarcomere shorten.\n- Slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibers are predominant in long-distance runners.\n- Fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers are predominant in powerlifters and sprinters.\n- Slow-twitch muscle fibers use aerobic oxygen.\n- Fast-twitch muscle fibers use anaerobic oxygen.\n- Slow-twitch muscle fibers have low glycogen content.\n- Fast-twitch muscle fibers have high glycogen content.\n- Slow-twitch muscle fibers are slow to fatigue.\n- Fast-twitch muscle fibers are quick to fatigue.\n- Slow-twitch muscle fibers have many mitochondria.\n- Fast-twitch muscle fibers have few mitochondria.\n- Slow-twitch muscle fibers have high myoglobin content and appear more red.\n- Fast-twitch muscle fibers have low myoglobin content and appear more white.\n- Reinnervation of muscle results in aberrant reorganization of type I and II muscle units, called fiber type grouping.\n- Skeletal muscle response to activity is hypertrophy, not hyperplasia.\n- Powerlifting increases muscle cell size but does not increase mitochondria.\n- Atrophy in the setting of inactivity results in increased ubiquitination.\n- Skeletal muscle protein helps maintain normal serum glucose levels during fasting.\n- Skeletal muscle does not contain glucose-6-phosphatase and does not directly carry out gluconeogenesis.\n- Glucogenic amino acids can be liberated from skeletal muscle during fasting for gluconeogenesis in the liver.\n- The kidney can also carry out gluconeogenesis.\n- Insulin increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscle via GLUT4.\n- ATP does not fall appreciably during a series of muscle twitches because it is quickly regenerated from creatine phosphate.\n- USMLE may include images of shoulder, clavicular, and humeral fractures.\n- Understanding normal shoulder anatomy is important for the USMLE."
