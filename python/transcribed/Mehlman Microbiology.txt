Conjugation,
generalized
transduction,
specialized
transduction,
and
transformation
are
known
as
horizontal
gene
transfer
(HGT),
which
is
when
genes,
especially
those
conferring
antibiotics
resistance,
can
move
between
bacteria
asexually .
These
processes
are
annoying
when
you’re
first
studying
for
Step
1,
but
unfortunately
the
exam
asks
some
questions
about
these.
I
consider
them
fairly
basic
to
know ,
even
during
the
pass/fail
Step
1
era.
Before
discussing
these
specific
processes,
a
HY
general
principle
you
need
to
know
is
that
most
bacteria
carry
their
antibiotics
resistance
genes
on
a
plasmid,
rather
than
in
their
chromosomal
DNA.
A
plasmid
is
a
small,
circular ,
dsDNA
molecule
that
is
separate
from
a
bacterium’ s
chromosomal
DNA
and
can
replicate
independently .
The
USMLE
will
ask
something
like,
“A
bacterial
colony
that
is
observed
to
replicate
over
many
generations
loses
its
resistance
to
vancomycin.
Which
of
the
following
mechanisms
is
the
most
likely
explanation
for
this
finding?”
And
the
answer
is
just
“loss
of
plasmid.”
Not
complicated.
But
if
you
don’t
know
the
factoid
about
antibiotics
resistance
genes
normally
being
carried
on
the
plasmid,
you’d
be
like
what
the
fuck?
Conjugation
Conjugation
is
when
genes
(usually
for
antibiotics
resistance)
are
transferred
from
one
bacterium
to
another
via
a
tube
called
a
pilus.

--- Page 8 ---

The
way
the
USMLE
will
ask
this
is
they
will
say
something
like,
“A
researcher
is
conducting
an
experiment
about
antibiotics
gene
transfer .
Which
of
the
following
observations
would
best
support
the
conclusion
that
conjugation
is
the
method
of
transfer?”
Then
the
answer
is,
“direct
cell
to
cell
contact.”
In
other
words,
the
tube/pilus
that
connects
the
two
bacterium
necessitates
cell-to-cell
contact.
I
haven’t
seen
the
USMLE
specifically
assess
the
notion
of
F+
vs
F-,
but
the
detail
isn’t
dramatic
to
know .
The
donor
is
called
F+
and
the
recipient
F-.
Generalized
transduction


--- Page 9 ---

Transduction
refers
to
a
phage
(viral)
particle
transferring
genes
from
one
bacterium
to
another .
Generalized
transduction
is
when
a
phage
particle
enters
a
bacterial
cell,
packages
up
random
fragments
from
the
bacterium’ s
DNA
genome
within
its
new
phage
particles,
then
leaves
the
cell,
infecting
a
new
bacterium
and
spreading
these
genes
as
a
result.
During
the
process
of
generalized
transduction,
the
phage
particle
does
not
incorporate
itself
into
the
bacterial
genome
when
it
packages
up
DNA.
In
other
words,
there
is
no
lysogenic
process
(lysogeny)
as
part
of
the
process.
Lysogeny
refers
to
the
ability
of
some
viruses
to
incorporate
themselves
into
the
nucleic
acid
of
the
host
and
then
reemerge
later.
USMLE
Qs
on
this
topic
are
fairly
straightforward.
They
might
say
something
like,
“Which
of
the
following
observations
by
a
researcher
supports
generalized
transduction
as
the
mechanism
for
antibiotics
gene
transfer?”
And
the
answer
will
be
something
like,
“Non-lysogenic
phage
particles
present.”
The
answer
on
its
own
can
sound
cryptic/arcane,
but
now
that
we
discussed
it,
it’s
not
so
bad.
Specialized
transduction


--- Page 10 ---

Specialized
transduction
is
when
a
viral
(phage)
particle
enters
a
bacterial
cell,
lysogenically
incorporates
itself
into
the
bacterial’ s
DNA
genome,
then
reemerges
with
flanking
bacterial
DNA
sequences
which
are
then
packaged
into
new
phage
particles.
These
new
phage
particles
then
infect
other
bacterial
cells
and
transfer
these
flanked
genes.
The
reason
this
type
of
transduction
is
called
specialized
is
because
the
transferred
bacterial
DNA
isn’t
random;
it
is
specific
to
the
site
on
the
bacterium’ s
genome
where
the
virus
incorporates
itself,
which
in
some
cases
can
predictably
be
genes
encoding
toxins
or
antibiotics
resistance.
In
comparison
to
generalized
transduction,
you
can
see
that
in
specialized,
once
the
virus
enters
the
cell,
it’s
nucleic
acid
becomes
integrates
lysogenically
within
the
bacterium’ s.
Upon
reemergence,
we
now
have
viral
nucleic
acid
with
flanking
bacterial
sequences.


--- Page 11 ---

The
USMLE
could
ask
which
of
the
following
observations
by
a
researcher
about
transferred
bacterial
genes
would
support
specialized
transduction
as
the
mechanism.
The
answer
will
be
something
like,
“Genes
traced
to
locus
adjacent
viral
excision
site.”
Wording
can
seem
a
bit
recondite,
but
it’s
not
hard
now
that
we
discussed
it.
Transformation
Transformation
is
when
a
bacterial
cell
picks
up
free
DNA
fragments/genes
directly
from
the
extracellular
medium.
Bacteria
that
are
capable
of
transformation
are
known
as
“competent.”
S.
pneumo
is
known
as
a
natural
transformer ,
and
is
therefore
competent.
The
highest
yield
point
for
USMLE
is
that
transformation
can
be
disrupted
when
DNase
is
added
to
the
surrounding
medium.
This
is
because
it
will
break
down
any
free
DNA
fragments/genes
that
are
floating
around
and
exposed.
The
USMLE
will
ask
something
like,
“Which
of
the
following
observations
by
a
researcher
most
likely
supports
transformation
as
the
mechanism
for
antibiotics
resistance
gene
transfer?”
The
answer
will
be
something
like,
“Process
is
disrupted
with
addition
of
nucleotidase.”
Or
they
can
say,
“A
researcher
is
conducting
an
experiment
regarding
bacterial
antibiotics
gene
transfer .
It
is
observed
that
the
process
is
disrupted
by
the
addition

What
is
the
most

transfer?”
Answer
=

is
when
a
bacterial
cell
picks
up
free
DNA
fragments/genes
directly
from
the
extracellular
medium.
Bacteria
that
are
capable
of
transformation
are
known
as
“competent.”
S.
pneumo
is
known
as
a
natural
transformer ,
and
is
therefore
competent.


--- Page 17 ---

The
highest
yield
point
for
USMLE
is
that
transformation
can
be
disrupted
when
DNase
is
added
to
the
surrounding
medium.
This
is
because
it
will
break
down
any
free
DNA
fragments/genes
that
are
floating
around
and
exposed.
The
USMLE
will
ask
something
like,
“Which
of
the
following
observations
by
a
researcher
most
likely
supports
transformation
as
the
mechanism
for
antibiotics
resistance
gene
transfer?”
The
answer
will
be
something
like,
“Process
is
disrupted
with
addition
of
nucleotidase.”

A
researcher
observes
that
a
bacterial
colony
replicated
over
many
generations
loses
its
resistance
to
vancomycin.
What
mechanism
is
the
most
likely
explanation
for
this
finding?
“Loss
of
plasmid.”
A
HY
general
principle
you
need
to
know
is
that
most
bacteria
carry
their
antibiotics
resistance
genes
on
a
plasmid,
rather
than
in
their
chromosomal
DNA.
A
plasmid
is
a
small,
circular ,
dsDNA
molecule
that
is
separate
from
a
bacterium’ s
chromosomal
DNA
and
can
replicate
independently .
The
USMLE
will
ask
something
like,
“A
bacterial
colony
that
is
observed
to
replicate
over

loses
its
resistance
to
vancomycin.
Which
of
the
following
mechanisms
is
the
most
likely
explanation
for
this
finding?”
And
the
answer
is
just
“loss
of
plasmid.”
Not
complicated.
But
if
you
don’t
know
the
factoid
about
antibiotics
resistance
genes
normally
being
carried
on
the
plasmid,
you’d
be
like
what
the
fuck?
10.
Which
observation
by
a
researcher
about
transferred
bacterial
genes
would
support
specialized
transduction
as
the
mechanism?Answer
can
be
something
like
“Genes
traced
to
locus
adjacent
viral
excision
site.”
Specialized
transduction
is
when
a
viral
(phage)
particle
enters
a
bacterial
cell,
lysogenically
incorporates
itself
into
the
bacterial’ s
DNA
genome,
then
reemerges
with
flanking
bacterial
DNA
sequences
which
are
then
packaged
into
new
phage
particles.
These
new
phage
particles
then
infect
other
bacterial
cells
and
transfer
these
flanked
genes.
The
reason
this
type
of
transduction
is
called
specialized
is
because
the
transferred
bacterial
DNA
isn’t
random;
it
is
specific
to
the
site
on
the
bacterium’ s
genome
where

--- Page 18 ---

the
virus
incorporates
itself,
which
in
some
cases
can
predictably
be
genes
encoding
toxins
or
antibiotics
resistance.
In
comparison
to
generalized
transduction,
you
can
see
that
in
specialized,
once
the
virus
enters
the
cell,
it’s
nucleic
acid
becomes
integrates
lysogenically
within
the
bacterium’ s.
Upon
reemergence,
we
now
have
viral
nucleic
acid
with
flanking
bacterial
sequences.
The
USMLE
could
ask
which
of
the
following
observations
by
a
researcher
about
transferred
bacterial
genes
would
support
specialized
transduction
as
the
mechanism.
The
answer
will
be
something
like,
“Genes
traced
to
locus
adjacent
viral
excision
site.”
Wording
can
seem
a
bit
recondite,
but
it’s
not
hard
now
that
we
discussed
it.

Which

would
best
support
the
conclusion
that
conjugation
is
the
method
of

The
way
the
USMLE
will
ask
this
is
they
will
say
something
like,
“A

Which
of
the

Then
the
answer
is,
“direct

In
other
words,
the
tube/pilus
that
connects
the
two
bacterium
necessitates
cell-to-cell
contact.
Conjugation
is
when
genes
(usually

in
Peds.
Once

he/she
has

or
full-blown
aplastic

(where
all

There
is
increased

Next
best

However ,
the

can
cause
laryngeal

which
means
the
patient
is
infected
at

Adenovirus
Most
common
cause
of
viral
conjunctivitis.
Will
present
as
teary
eye
that
is
either
unilateral
or
bilateral,
and
either
itchy
or
non-itchy .
Treatment
is
supportive
with
saline
rinse.
Can
also
cause
hemorrhagic
cystitis
(albeit
more
rare).
For
example,
USMLE
can
give
easy
vignette
of
viral
conjunctivitis
in
a
school-age
kid
+
ask
what
else
is
most
likely
to
develop
in
the

–>
answer
=
hematuria.
Hepatitis
B
Mandatory
stuff
for
USMLE
is
the
serology
(I
discuss
below).
Most
common
hepatitis
infection
in
the
worldwide.
USMLE
likes
China
for
hepatitis
B.
Just
a
pattern
I’ve
noticed.
Due
to
  increased
unvaccinated.
In
the
USA,
HepC
is
most
common.
Parenteral;
can
be
acute
or
chronic.
Transmitted
vertically
from
mother
to
neonate,
sex,
IV
drugs,
or
blood
exposure.
Present
in
all
body
fluids,
including
breast
milk.
Serology
very
HY
(I
discuss
meaning
of
variables
below
the
table):

--- Page 24 ---

HBsAg
=
HepB
surface
antigen.
HBsAb
=
HepB
surface
antibody;
if
positive,
patient
is
immune;
if
negative,
patient
is
not
immune.


--- Page 25 ---

HBcAb
=
HepB
core
antibody;
if
positive,
patient
either
currently
has
HepB
or
had
it
in
the
past
(i.e.,
cleared
it).
HBcAb
IgM
=
has
acute
infection.
HBcAb
IgG
=
has
chronic
HepB
or
has
cleared
it.
Window
period
=
Once
a
susceptible
patient
is
exposed
to
HepB
and
the
immune
system
attempts
to
clear
it,
sometimes
Surface
antigen
will
decline
to
the
point
that
it
is
no
longer
detectible.
But
at
the
same
time,
the
Surface
antibody
might
not
be
high
enough
/
at
detectable
levels
yet.
This
is
called
the
“window
period,”
where
both
Surface
antigen
and
antibody
are
negative,
so
it
can
appear
as
though
the
patient
doesn’t
have
an
infection.
However ,
Core
antibody
IgM
will
be
(+).
So
the
key
point
is
that
1)
you
know
the
double-negative
Surface
antibody/antigen
combo
is
seen
in
the
window
period,
and
2)
that
Core
antibody
IgM
is
most
reliable
during
the
window
period.
Vaccination
against
HepB
is
at
birth,
2
months,
and
6
months
(no
longer
at
4
months).
Only
give
HepB
IVIG
to
neonate
if
mom
is
confirmed
(+).
A
2CK
NBME
Q
gives
mother ’s
status
as
unknown
when
child
is
born
–>
answer
=
“Give
HepB
vaccine
now
+
only
give
IVIG
if
mother
is
positive.”
If
patient
has
Hx
of
completed
HepB
vaccination
but
has
titers
that
show
susceptibility ,
the
answer
is
just
“give
more
vaccine.”
Sometimes
people’ s
immunity
wanes.
USMLE
really
doesn’t
give
a
fuck
about
HepB
pharm
(i.e.,
entecavir ,
tenofovir).
Waste
of
time.
You
could
be
aware
that
interferon-alpha
can
be
used
for
HepB.
Poxvirus
Largest
DNA
virus.
Causes
molloscum
cantagiosum,
which
presents
as
skin-colored
or
reddish
papules
with
central
umbilication.
Very
HY
spot-diagnosis
for

--- Page 26 ---

USMLE
likes
giving
vignette
where
kid
went
to
a
recent
pool
party .
You
can
also
be
aware
of
another
poxvirus
called
Vaccinia,
which
is
similar
to
smallpox
and
was
used
in
the
development
of
the
smallpox
vaccine.
“Vaccinia”
shows
up
as
an
answer
on
a
new
NBME
where
they
talk
about
smallpox
eradication.
Herpes
simplex
(HSV)
1/2
Causes
painful
vesicular
lesions
of
the
lips
and
genitalia
that
recur
at
varying
intervals
(usually
months).
Primary
infection
is
most
severe,
often
with
fever ,
regional
lymphadenopathy ,
burning/stinging/itching
pain
(herpetic
neuralgia),
and
many
vesicles.
Recurrences
are
often
less
severe
and
preceded
by
herpetic
neuralgia.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
herpes
goes
latent
in
sensory
nerves
(makes
sense,
since
recurrences
cause
neuralgia/pain).
Don’t
confuse
HSV1/2
with
chancroid
caused
by
the
bacterium
Haemophilus
ducreyi
.
HSV1/2
will
be
usually
be
clusters
of
painful
lesions
that
demonstrate
recurrence
,
whereas
chancroid
will
be
a
singular
lesion
that
is
not
recurrent.
There
is
one
Q
out
there
where
they
give
you
a
singular
painful
lesion
with
recurrence,
and
the
answer
is
HSV,
not
H.
ducreyi.
In
this
case,
the
recurrence
is
what
tells
you
it’s
HSV1/2.
Perhaps
in
some
cases,
herpetic
infections
can
start
as
a
single
vesicle
before
erupting
into
the
typical
cluster-appearance.
H.
ducreyi
is
also
typically
acquired
overseas,
e.g.,
in
backpackers
traveling
in
the
third-world.
HSV1/2
can
cause
herpes
encephalitis
(confusion
+
blood
in
CSF
due
to
temporal
lobe
hemorrhage).


--- Page 27 ---

I
would
say
4/5
herpes
encephalitis
Qs
mention
blood
in
the
CSF.
There’ s
one
2CK
neuro
form
Q
where
the
blood
is
negative,
but
the
CSF
findings
are
otherwise
viral
(normal
glucose
and
protein;
high
lymphocytes).
You
also
need
to
know
that
CT
of
the
head
can
be
negative.
I
mention
this
because
even
though
it
can
cause
temporal
lobe
hemorrhage,
the
Q
can
say
CT
shows
no
abnormalities.
They
might
mention
spikes
over
the
temporal
region
(implying
there’ s
still
abnormality/hemorrhage
there).
So
they
can
say
something
like:
24-year-old
male
with
confusion
and
fever
+
viral
CSF
findings
+
blood
in
CSF
+
CT
of
head
shows
no
abnormalities
+
EEG
shows
spikes
over
temporal
region.
Answer
=
intravenous
acyclovir .
Can
cause
herpetic
whitlow ,
which
presents
as
vesicles
on
the
finger
in
a
child
who’s
touched
a
mother ’s
cold
sore
while
breastfeeding,
or
in
dental
workers/hygienists.
Herpetic
whitlow
Can
cause
eczema
herpeticum,
which
is
HSV1/2
infection
superimposed
on
eczema.
Can
present
with
stinging/burning
pain
(herpetic
neuralgia).
Treat
with
acyclovir .
Eczema
herpeticum


--- Page 28 ---

Can
cause
herpes
keratitis
(inflammation
of
the
cornea).
Presents
as
dendritic
(tree-like)
pattern
on
fluorescein
instillation
of
the
eye.
It
may
or
may
not
present
with
periorbital
vesicles.
Herpes
keratitis
Herpes
esophagitis
presents
as
punched-out
ulcers
and
odynophagia
(pain
with
swallowing).
This
is
in
contrast
to
CMV
esophagitis,
which
causes
linear/confluent
ulcers.
Viral
culture
can
be
negative
in
stem
(not
100%
sensitive).
Treat
with
acyclovir
(or
valacyclovir),
which
is
a
DNA
polymerase
inhibitor .
HSV1/2
resistance
to
acyclovir
occurs
via
altered
viral
thymidine
kinase.
Varicella
zoster
virus
(VZV;
human
herpes
virus-3;
HHV-3)
Causes
chickenpox;
can
be
described
as
clusters
of
vesicles
at
different
stages
of
healing
on
an
unvaccinated
child
or
adult.
Chickenpox
Qs
are
exceedingly
rare
for
USMLE.
What
they
actually
care
about
is
shingles.
Shingles
is
aka
herpes
zoster .
Herpes
zoster
is
not
the
name
of
a
virus.
This
is
just
another
name
for
shingles.
So
we
can
say,
shingles,
aka
herpes
zoster ,
is
caused
by
varicella
zoster
virus.
Shingles
presents
as
vesicles
erupting
in
a
dermatomal
distribution
(i.e.,
usually
on
the
flank
or
back
of
neck)
idiopathically
in
middle-age
individuals
or
older .
Can
be
brought
on
by
stress
or
transient
negative
flux
in
immunity .


--- Page 29 ---

Once
the
vesicles
rupture,
they
can
sometimes
look
black.
So
just
know
it’s
weird
but
possible.
What’ s
most
telling
for
herpetic
infections
(whether
it
be
HSV1/2,
or
VZV
causing
shingles)
is
that
they
form
characteristic
clusters
of
small
vesicles.
It’s
this
characteristic
clustering
that
can
be
buzzy/easy
for
herpetic
infection.
Shingles
can
occur
in
immunocompromised
kids
(e.g.,
those
undergoing
chemotherapy).
This
is
called
pediatric
shingles.
Just
know
“it’s
a
thing.”
Because
most
students
think
it
only
occurs
in
middle
age
or
older .
Pediatric
shingles
Can
cause
herpes
zoster
ophthalmicus
(periorbital
vesicles),
which
means
shingles
of
the
eye.
This
may
or
may
not
co-present
with
keratitis
(and
the
dendritic
pattern)
that
looks
identical
to
that
caused
by
HSV1/2.
Can
cause
herpes
zoster
oticus
(vesicles
in
the
ear),
which
means
shingles
of
the
ear.
This
may
or
may
not
present
with
concurrent
Bell’s
palsy
due
to
CN
VII
involvement.
Bell’s
palsy
due
to
shingles
is
called
Ramsay-Hunt
syndrome
type
II.
Herpes
zoster
oticus
Vaccination
against
VZV
occurs
with
two
doses:
the
first
at
12-15
months;
the
second
at
4-6
years.


--- Page 30 ---

Shingles
vaccine
is
given
at
age
50
(on
new
Family
Med
form).
These
vaccines
are
live-attenuated.
Treat
shingles
with
acyclovir
(or
valacyclovir).
Varicella
can
cause
pneumonia
in
immunocompromised
and
pregnant
women.
Slightly
unusual,
but
just
know
it’s
possible.
VZV
immunoglobulin
is
given
to
a
neonate
if
an
unvaccinated
pregnant
woman
develops
a
chickenpox
rash
within
5
days
prior
to
2
days
post-parturition.
If
pregnant
woman
contracts
chickenpox,
the
fetus
may
develop
congenital
varicella
syndrome,
which
can
present
as
microcephaly
and
skin
vesicles
demonstrating
a
“zig-zag”
pattern.
Ebstein-Barr
virus
(EBV;
human
herpes
virus-4;
HHV-4)
Causes
mononucleosis,
nasopharyngeal
carcinoma,
oral
hairy
leukoplakia,
and
both
Hodgkin
and
non-Hodgkin
(notably
Burkitt)
lymphomas.
Mononucleosis
is
usually
caused
by
EBV,
but
can
also
be
CMV .
The
virus
invades
B
cells,
which
then
stimulates
the
immune
system
to
produce
CD8+
T
cells
attacking
the
viral-infected
B
cells.
In
mono,
these
CD8+
T
cells
are
called
“atypical
lymphocytes.”
The
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
these
are
reactive
CD8+
T
cells.
They
are
“reactive”
because
they
are
responding
to
the
viral-infected
B
cells.
Primary
infection
presents
usually
in
teenager
or
young
adult
with
fever
>38
C,
lymphadenopathy ,
tonsillar
exudates,
and
lack
of
cough,
making
the
presentation
appear
bacterial
(in
the
HY
Pulmonary
PDF
,
I
talk
about
CENT OR
criteria
for
differentiating
bacterial
from
viral
URTIs).
As
a
result,
it
is
often
misdiagnosed
as
Strep
pharyngitis.
If
amoxicillin
or
penicillin
is
given
to
treat
EBV,
this
can
cause
a
rash.
This
is
not
to
be
confused
with
a
rash
caused
by
allergy
to
beta-lactams.
If
pre-adolescent
receives
beta-lactam
and
gets
a
rash,
that
is
likely
beta-lactam
allergy .
If
a
patient
adolescent
or
older
gets
a
rash,
we
do
a
heterophile
antibody
(Monospot)
test
as
next
best
step
in
diagnosis,
as
EBV
mono
is
more
likely .

--- Page 31 ---

The
heterophile
antibody
test
is
how
we
diagnose
EBV,
where
for
some
magical
reason,
the
antibodies
we
produce
against
EBV
cross-react
with
horse
and
sheep
RBCs,
hence
the
antibodies
like
(-phile)
different
(hetero-)
antigens.
Following
the
primary
infection,
mono
can
present
as
recurrent
episodes
of
extreme
fatigue
that
arise
at
interval
of
months
to
years.
Nasopharyngeal
carcinoma
is
a
type
of
squamous
cell
carcinoma.
Oral
hairy
leukoplakia
presents
as
white
lesions
on
the
tongue
that
cannot
be
scraped
off.
They
are
not
pre-cancerous
(no
dysplasia
on
biopsy).
This
is
in
contrast
to
“regular”
leukoplakia
caused
by
tobacco,
which
is
a
precursor
to
SCC.
The
increased
risk
of
Hodgkin
and
non-Hodgkin
lymphomas
is
because
EBV
invades
B
cells.
Cytomegalovirus
(CMV;
human
herpes
virus-5;
HHV-5)
Most
common
organism
transmitted
via
blood
transfusions
and
organ
transplants.
Causes
infections
of
many
different
organ
systems
(e.g.,
lung,
kidney ,
GI
tract,
retina),
as
well
as
CMV
mono.
There
is
an
NBME
Q
where
they
give
CMV
pneumonia
in
patient
following
renal
transplant,
where
they
show
the
buzzy
owl-eye
appearance
of
cells.
USMLE
likes
“intranuclear
inclusions”
or
“intranuclear
inclusion
bodies”
for
CMV .
This
refers
to
the
“owl
eyes”
that
can
be
seen
on
histo.


--- Page 32 ---

CMV
esophagitis
presents
as
linear/confluent
ulcers
and
odynophagia.
This
is
in
contrast
to
HSV1/2,
which
cause
punched-out
ulcers.
CMV
colitis
presents
as
linear/confluent
ulcers
in
AIDS
patients
with
CD4
counts
under
50-100.
Blurry
vision
in
HIV
patient
=
CMV
retinitis
until
proven
otherwise.
CMV
mono
is
differentiated
from
EBV
mono
in
that
the
former
has
a
negative
heterophile
antibody
(Monospot)
test.
Additionally ,
CMV
can
cause
cold
autoimmune
hemolytic
anemia
due
to
the
production
of
IgM
antibodies
against
RBCs,
with
a
positive
Coombs
test
(means
we
have
antibodies
against
RBCs).
So
if
patient
with
mono
has
low
hemoglobin
and
high
LDH,
for
instance,
that
could
point
toward
CMV
over
EBV.
High
LDH
on
USMLE
almost
always
means
hemolysis,
since
RBCs
are
packed
with
LDH.
CMV
is
treated
with
ganciclovir ,
which
is
a
DNA
polymerase
inhibitor .
CMV
resistance
to
ganciclovir
occurs
via
altered
viral
thymidine
kinase.
The
MOA
and
resistance
mechanisms
are
the
same
as
HSV1/2
and
VZV
with
respect
to
acyclovir .
The
stem
might
mention
a
patient
who
had
a
kidney
transplant
6
months
ago
who
now
has
deteriorating
renal
function
+
intra-nuclear
inclusions
seen
on
biopsy .
The
answer
is
just
“ganciclovir
therapy .”
Human

Usually
seen
in
immunocompromised
patients
(i.e.,

that
is
either
unilateral

Treatment
is
supportive
with

Can
also
cause
hemorrhagic
cystitis
(albeit
more
rare).
For

+
ask
what
else
is
most

non-enveloped,
ds-circular
10.
What
does
HPV
6+11
cause
vs
HPV
16+18?
HPV
6+11
cause
condylomata
acuminata
(geneital
warts).
However ,
the
warts
caused
by
strains
6+11
are
not
limited
to
the
genitalia
and
can
cause
laryngeal
papillomatosis
in
neonates
(warts
of
the
vocal
cords),
which
is
asked
on
NBME.
Lesions
will
have
papillary
structures
on
biopsy .
Acquired
vertically
via
exposure
from
maternal
vaginal
canal.
HPV
16+18
cause
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
genitalia/anus;
risk
of
overt
SCC
is
increased
 
in
immunocompromised
(i.e.,
HIV
in
MSM)
and
heavy
smoking.
Students
will
get
maniacal
about
other

13.
What
are
two
ways
CMV
mono
can
be
differentiated
from
EBV
mono?
CMV
mono
is
differentiated
from
EBV
mono
in
that
the
former
has
a
negative
heterophile
antibody
(Monospot)
test.
Additionally ,
CMV
can
cause
cold

due
to
the
production
of
IgM
antibodies
against

So
if
patient
with

has
low

and
high
LDH,
for
instance,
that
could
point
toward
CMV
over
EBV.
High
LDH
on
USMLE
almost
always
means
hemolysis,
since
RBCs
are

21.
How
does
shingles
present?
Which
virus
causes
it?
How
is
it
treated?
Shingles
is
aka
herpes
zoster .
Herpes
zoster
is
not
the
name
of
a
virus.
This
is
just
another
name
for
shingles.
So
we
can
say,
shingles,
aka
herpes
zoster ,
is
caused
by
varicella
zoster
virus
(VZV).
Shingles
presents
as
vesicles
erupting
in
a
dermatomal
distribution
(i.e.,
usually
on
the
flank
or
back
of
neck)
idiopathically
in
middle-age
individuals
or
older .
Can
be
brought
on
by
stress
or
transient
negative
flux
in
immunity .
Once
the
vesicles
rupture,
they
can
sometimes
look
black.
So
just
know
it’s
weird
but
possible.
What’ s
most
telling
for
herpetic
infections
(whether
it
be
HSV1/2,
or
VZV
causing
shingles)
is
that
they
form
characteristic
clusters
of
small
vesicles.
It’s
this
characteristic
clustering
that
can
be
buzzy/easy
for
herpetic
infection.
Treatment
is
acyclovir
(or
valacyclovir).

called?
What
about
if
there’ s
Bell’s
palsy?
Can
cause
herpes
zoster
ophthalmicus
(periorbital
vesicles),
which
means
shingles
of
the
eye.
This
may
or
may
not
co-present
with
keratitis
(and
the
dendritic
pattern)
that
looks
identical
to
that
caused
by
HSV1/2.
Can
cause
herpes
zoster
oticus
(vesicles
in

warts).
However ,
the
warts
caused
by

6+11
are
not

29.
17-year-old
boy
with
suspected
Strep
pharyngitis
develops
a
rash
after
receiving
amoxicillin.
What
two
possibilities
for
the
rash
must
be
considered?
Either
EBV
mononucleosis
or
allergy
to
beta-lactam.
If
amoxicillin
or
penicillin
is
inadvertently
given
to
treat
EBV,
this
can
cause
a
rash.
This
is
not
to
be
confused
with
a
rash
caused
by
allergy
to
beta-lactams.
If
pre-adolescent
receives
beta-lactam
and
gets
a
rash,
that
is
likely
beta-lactam
allergy .
If
a
patient
adolescent
or
older
gets
a
rash,
we
do
a
heterophile
antibody
(Monospot)
test
as
next
best
step
in
diagnosis,
as
EBV
mono
is
more
likely .
The
heterophile
antibody
test
is
how
we
diagnose
EBV,
where
for
some
magical
reason,
the
antibodies
we
produce
against
EBV
cross-react
with
horse
and
sheep
RBCs,
hence
the
antibodies
like
(-phile)
different
(hetero-)
antigens.
30.
Which
DNA
virus
is
associated
with
development
of
pure-RBC
aplasia
and
aplastic
anemia?
Parvovirus
B19.
Causes
Fifth
disease
=
“slapped
cheek”
facial
erythema
in
Peds.
Once
child
has
developed
the
red
cheeks,
he/she
has
immunologically
cleared
the
illness
(i.e.,
if
they
turn
it
into
a
behavioral
science
Q,
tell
parents
to
chill
the
fuck
out
/
relax
because
the
child
has
cleared
the
virus).
Can
cause
exanthem
(body
rash)
+/-
arthritis
in
adults,
especially
in
daycare
workers
(USMLE
is
obsessed
with
this).

--- Page 45 ---

Can
cause
pure-RBC
aplasia
(i.e.,
only
RBCs
are
low)
or
full-blown
aplastic
anemia
(where
all
cell
lines
–
RBCs,
WBCs,
and
platelets
–
are
down).
There
is
increased
risk
of
pure-RBC
aplasia
and
aplastic
anemia
if
the
infection
occurs
in
utero
and
in
sickle
cell
patients.
Next
best
step
in
diagnosis
for
Fifth
disease
or
exanthem/arthritis
is
check
serum
IgM
titers.
If
any
of
the
hematologic
cell
lines
are
down,
do
bone
marrow
biopsy
to
confirm
diagnosis.
31.
Which
virus
classically
causes
neuronal
degeneration
in
an
AIDS
patient?
JC
polyoma
virus
Causes
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML).
Presents
as
neurodegeneration
over
weeks
to
months
in
immunocompromised
patient
–
i.e.,
AIDS
patient
with
CD4
count
<100,
patients
undergoing
chemoradiotherapy ,
or
those
on
immunosuppressant
drugs.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
this
condition
is
due
to
“reactivation
of
latent
infection,”
which
means
the
patient
is
infected
at
some
point
during
life
years
ago,
but
the
condition
now
manifests
due
to
immunosuppression.
“Acute
infection
in
immunocompromised
patient”
is
the
wrong
answer .
32.
What
does
poxvirus
cause?
Causes
molloscum
cantagiosum,
which
presents
as
skin-colored
or
reddish
papules
with
central
umbilication.
Very
HY
spot-diagnosis
for
Peds.

--- Page 46 ---

USMLE
likes
giving
vignette
where
kid
went
to
a
recent
pool
party .
You
can
also
be
aware
of
another
poxvirus
called
Vaccinia,
which
is
similar
to
smallpox
and
was
used
in
the
development
of
the
smallpox
vaccine.
“Vaccinia”
shows
up
as
an
answer
on
a
new
NBME
where
they
talk
about
smallpox
eradication.
33.
What
is
bacillary
angiomatosis?
Bacillary
angiomatosis
caused
by
Bartonella
henselae
(normally
causes
cat-scratch
disease)
can
present
as
Kaposi
sarcoma-like
lesions.
What
USMLE
will
do
is
give
you
a
vignette
that
sounds
just
like
Kaposi
sarcoma
(i.e.,
AIDS
patient
with
violaceous
skin
lesions),
followed
by
asking
you
for
the
organism
that
causes
it.
You’ll
notice
that
HHV-8
(as
well
has
HepC
for
lichen
planus)
isn’t
listed,
where
all
the
answers
are
bacteria,
and
you
just
select
Bartonella
henselae
.
35.
What
does
BK
polyoma
virus
cause?Causes
kidney
infections
in
kidney
transplant
patients.
Rare.
You
could
just
be
aware
it
exists.
I
believe
one
Q
ever
in
history
exists
on
NBME
somewhere.
36.
How
do
primary
vs
recurrent
HSV1/2
infections
present?
Herpes
goes
latent
in
what
type
of
nerves?


--- Page 47 ---

Causes
painful
vesicular
lesions
of
the
lips
and
genitalia
that
recur
at
varying
intervals
(usually
months).
Primary
infection
is
most
severe,
often
with
fever ,
regional
lymphadenopathy ,
burning/stinging/itching
pain
(herpetic
neuralgia),
and
many
vesicles.
Recurrences
are
often
less
severe
and
preceded
by
herpetic
neuralgia.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
herpes
goes
latent
in
sensory
nerves
(makes
sense,
since
recurrences
cause
neuralgia/pain).
37.
Which
bacterium
can
cause
infections
sometimes
confused
with
genital
herpes
infections?
Don’t
confuse
HSV1/2
with
chancroid
caused
by
the
bacterium
Haemophilus
ducreyi
.
HSV1/2
will
be
usually
be
clusters
of
painful
lesions
that
demonstrate
recurrence
,
whereas
chancroid
will
be
a
singular
lesion
that
is
not
recurrent.
There
is
one
Q
out
there
where
they
give
you
a
singular
painful
lesion
with
recurrence,
and
the
answer
is
HSV,
not
H.
ducreyi.
In
this
case,
the
recurrence
is
what
tells
you
it’s
HSV1/2.
Perhaps
in
some
cases,
herpetic
infections
can
start
as
a
single
vesicle
before
erupting
into
the
typical
cluster-appearance.
H.
ducreyi
is
also
typically
acquired
overseas,
e.g.,
in
backpackers
traveling
in
the
third-world.
38.
How
does
primary
mononucleosis
infection
present
vs
recurrence
of
the
condition?
Primary
infection
presents
usually
in
teenager
or
young
adult
with
fever
>38
C,
lymphadenopathy ,
tonsillar
exudates,
and
lack
of
cough,
making
the
presentation
appear
bacterial
(in
the
HY
Pulmonary
PDF
,
I
talk
about
CENT OR
criteria
for
differentiating
bacterial
from
viral
URTIs).
As
a
result,
it
is
often
misdiagnosed
as
Strep
pharyngitis.
Following
the
primary
infection,
mono
can
present
as
recurrent
episodes
of
extreme
fatigue
that
arise
at
interval
of
months
to
years.
39.
How
does
adult
Parvo
presentation
tend
to
differ
from
children’ s?

--- Page 48 ---

Which
adult
demographic

that
USMLE
is
obsessed
with?
Causes
Fifth

How
does

What’ s
special
about
the
labs?

--- Page 49 ---

Can
cause
herpes
encephalitis
(confusion
+
blood
in

due
to
temporal

hemorrhage).
I
would
say
4/5
herpes
encephalitis
Qs
mention
blood
in
the
CSF.
There’ s
one
2CK
neuro
form
Q
where
the
blood
is
negative,
but
the
CSF
findings
are
otherwise
viral
(normal
glucose
and
protein;
high
lymphocytes).
You
also
need
to
know
that
CT
of
the
head
can
be
negative.
I
mention
this
because
even
though
it
can
cause
temporal
lobe
hemorrhage,
the
Q
can
say
CT
shows
no
abnormalities.
They
might
mention
spikes
over
the
temporal
region
(implying
there’ s
still
abnormality/hemorrhage
there).
So
they
can
say
something
like:
24-year-old
male
with
confusion
and
fever
+
viral
CSF
findings
+
blood
in
CSF
+
CT
of
head
shows
no
abnormalities
+
EEG
shows
spikes
over
temporal
region.
Answer
=
intravenous
acyclovir .

What
type
of
hepatitis
B
serology
(i.e.,
HBs
Ag,
HBs
Ab,
HBc
Ab)
would
be
expected
for
patient
who’s
susceptible
to
HepB
(i.e.,
unvaccinated
status)?
HBsAg
=
HepB
surface
antigen.
HBsAb
=
HepB
surface
antibody;
if
positive,
patient
is
immune;
if
negative,
patient
is
not
immune.
HBcAb
=
HepB
core
antibody;
if
positive,
patient
either
currently
has
HepB
or
had
it
in
the
past
(i.e.,
cleared
it).
HBcAb
IgM
=
has
acute
infection.
HBcAb
IgG
=
has
chronic
HepB
or
has
cleared
it.
45.
When
do
we
vaccinate
against
HepB
(in
terms
of
patient
age)?
And
when
do
we
give
IVIG
to
neonate
if
mother ’s
HepB
status
is
unknown?

--- Page 50 ---

Vaccination
against
HepB
is
at
birth,
2
months,
and
6
months
(no
longer
at
4
months).
Only
give
HepB
IVIG
to
neonate
if
mom
is
confirmed
(+).
A
2CK
NBME
Q
gives
mother ’s
status
as
unknown
when
child
is
born
–>
answer
=
“Give
HepB
vaccine
now
+
only
give
IVIG
if
mother
is
positive.”
If
patient
has
Hx
of
completed
HepB
vaccination
but
has
titers
that
show
susceptibility ,
the
answer
is
just
“give
more
vaccine.”
Sometimes
people’ s
immunity
wanes.
46.
What
are
the
two
things
adenovirus
causes?
Most
common
cause
of
viral
conjunctivitis.
Will
present
as
teary
eye
that
is
either
unilateral
or
bilateral,
and
either
itchy
or
non-itchy .
Treatment
is
supportive
with
saline
rinse.
Can
also
cause
hemorrhagic
cystitis
(albeit
more
rare).
For
example,
USMLE
can
give
easy
vignette
of
viral
conjunctivitis
in
a
school-age
kid
+
ask
what
else
is
most
likely
to
develop
in
the
patient
–>
answer
=
hematuria.
47.
What
type
of
hepatitis
B
serology
(i.e.,
HBs
Ag,
HBs
Ab,
HBc
Ab)
would
be
expected
for
patient
who’s
in
the
HepB
window
period?
What
does
the
window
period
mean?
Window
period
=
patient
is
starting
to
clear
the
infection;
as
a
result,
HBsAg
is
no
longer
detected,
but
at
the
same
time,
HBsAb
is
also
not
yet
detectable,
so
the
patient
will
be
negative
for
both
HBsAb
and
HBsAg.
In
this
case,
HBcAb
IgM
is
most
reliable
as
evidence
of
the
infection.

When
do
we
vaccinate
against
varicella
in
children
and
adults?
What
kind
of
vaccine
is
it
(i.e.,
toxoid,
etc.)?

--- Page 51 ---

Vaccination
against
VZV
occurs
with
two
doses:
the
first
at
12-15
months;
the
second
at
4-6
years.
Shingles
vaccine
is
given
at
age
50
(on
new
Family
Med
form).
These
vaccines
are
live-attenuated.
Kaposi
sarcoma
is
violaceous,
tumorous
lesions
of
vascular-lymphatic
origin.
Usually
seen
in
immunocompromised
patients
(i.e.,
AIDS,
chemotherapy).
Q
can
show
you
image
such
as
above
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“anti-neoplastic”
for
the
Tx
(whereas
answers
like
anti-fungal,
anti-bacterial,
etc.,
are
wrong).
Bacillary
angiomatosis
caused
by
Bartonella
henselae
can
present
as
Kaposi

Shingles
can
occur
in
immunocompromised
kids
(e.g.,
those
undergoing
chemotherapy).
This
is
called
pediatric
shingles.
Just

How
is
CMV
treated?
What’ s
the
MOA
of
the
drug?
If
CMV
becomes
resistant
to
it,
what’ s
the
mechanism
of
resistance?
CMV
is
treated
with
ganciclovir ,
which
is
a
DNA
polymerase
inhibitor .
CMV
resistance
to
ganciclovir
occurs
via
altered
viral
thymidine
kinase.
The
MOA
and
resistance
mechanisms
are
the
same
as
HSV1/2
and
VZV
with
respect
to
acyclovir .
The
stem
might
mention
a
patient
who
had
a
kidney
transplant
6
months
ago
who
now
has
deteriorating
renal
function
+
intra-nuclear
inclusions
seen
on
biopsy .
The
answer
is
just
“ganciclovir
therapy .”

What
is
an
unusual
way
varicella
can
present
in
pregnant
women?
When
is
Varicella
IVIG
given
to
the
neonate?
How
does
congenital
varicella
syndrome
present?
Varicella
can
cause
pneumonia
in
immunocompromised
and
pregnant
women.
Slightly
unusual,
but
just
know
it’s
possible.
VZV
immunoglobulin
is
given
to
a
neonate
if
an
unvaccinated
pregnant
woman
develops
a
chickenpox
rash
within
5
days
prior
to
2
days
post-parturition.
If
pregnant
woman
contracts
chickenpox,
the
fetus
may
develop
congenital
varicella
syndrome,
which
can
present
as
microcephaly
and
skin
vesicles
demonstrating
a
“zig-zag”
pattern.

Presents
as
neurodegeneration
over
weeks
to
months
in
immunocompromised
patient
–
i.e.,
AIDS
patient
with
CD4
count
<100,
patients
undergoing
chemoradiotherapy ,
or
those
on
immunosuppressant
drugs.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
this
condition
is
due
to
“reactivation
of
latent
infection,”
which
means
the
patient
is
infected
at
some
point
during
life
years
ago,
but
the
condition
now
manifests
due
to
immunosuppression.
“Acute
infection
in
immunocompromised
patient”
is
the
wrong
answer .
Many
fungi
can
be
grown
on
Sabouraud
agar,
so
you
can
memorize
this
factoid
as
a
starter .
Dermatophytes
are
fungi
that
cause
skin
infections.
Trichophyton
spp.
T.
rubrum
causes
many
skin
infections,
including
tinea
corporis
(ring
worm),
tinea
cruris
(jock
itch),
tinea
pedis
(athlete’ s
foot).
It
also
causes
onychomycosis
(fungal
infection
of
the
nail).
USMLE
will
usually
not
play
trivia
where
they
list
5
different
fungi
and
you’re
expected
to
know
T.
rubrum
is
the
one
causing
the
tinea
corporis.
What
they’ll
do
is
literally
list
3
bacteria,
1
fungus,
and
a
miscellaneous
diagnosis
like
eczema,
and
then
you
just
choose
the
one
fungus
listed,
e.g.,
T.
rubrum
.
It’s
quite
easy.


--- Page 55 ---

T.
tonsurans
is
known
to
cause
tinea
capitis
(fungal
infection
of
the
scalp).
Microsporum
and
Epidermophyton
Microsporum
causes
tinea
corporis
and
tinea
capitis.
Epidermyophyton
causes
tinea
pedis
and
tinea
cruris.
You
do
not
need
to
memorize
these
specific
conditions
caused
by
Microsporum
and
Epidermophyton
.
I
just
want
you
to
know
these
fungal
names
are
dermatophytes
/
fungi
in
general.
What
USMLE
cares
about
is
you
being
able
to
spot-diagnose
dermatophyte
fungal
infections
via
an
image
and
then
choose
the
treatment.
The
above
image
is
tinea
capitis.
USMLE
will
show
you
this
image
and
then
the
answer
is
“oral
griseofulvin
for
patient
only”;
“oral
griseofulvin
for
patient
and
classmates”
is
wrong
answer .
Or
they’ll
show
the
above
image
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“
Trichophyton
tonsurans
,”
where
it’s
the
only
fungus
listed.
If
the
USMLE
asks
how
to
prevent
tinea
capitis,
the
answer
is
“avoidance
of
sharing
of
hats.”
Sounds
easy,
but
it’s
asked
on
an
NBME
and
many
students
get
it
wrong.
They
select
answers
like
“use
of
anti-fungal
shampoo”
or
“avoidance
of
wooded
areas,”
which
are
wrong.
Tinea
capitis
is
often
described
as
a
“circular
area
of
scaling
alopecia.”


--- Page 56 ---

The
above
image
is
tinea
corporis
(ring
worm).
The
Q
can
say
a
patient
has
pet
dogs
or
uses
yoga
mats
at
the
gym.
USMLE
will
show
you
this
image
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“clotrimazole”
or
“miconazole.”
We
treat
tinea
corporis,
tinea
pedis,
and
tinea
cruris
with
topical
-azoles.
You
need
to
know
clotrimazole
and
miconazole
are
specifically
topical,
whereas
others
like
fluconazole
and
itraconazole
are
oral.
Tinea
pedis
can
also
be
treated
with
topical
terbinafine.
Tinea
pedis
presents
as
itchy
scaling
between
the
webs
of
the
feet.
Above
image
shows
tinea
pedis.
There
is
an
NBME
has
a
Q
where
they
tell
you
a
febrile
patient
has
itchy,
erythematous
scaling
on
the
foot
that
extends
up
the
dorsum
of
the
foot
onto
the
ankle
+
they
ask
the
cause
of
the
fever
in
the
patient.
The
wrong
answer
is
Trichophyton
.
The
correct
answer
is
S.
aureus
.
Students
get
confused
by
this,
but
there’ s
two
points:
1)
they
ask
for
the
cause
of
the
fever;
fungi
rarely
cause
fever ,
whereas
S.
aureus
is
a
more
likely
culprit;
and
2)
tinea
pedis
usually
presents
as
itchy,


--- Page 57 ---

scaling
webs
between
the
toes;
the
erythematous
extension
up
to
the
ankle
is
likely
a
bacterial
cellulitis
that
has
superimposed
on
the
cracked
skin.
In
this
case,
oral
dicloxacillin
or
cephalexin
would
treat
the
S.
aureus
skin
infection;
topical
-azole
or
terbinafine
could
be
used
for
the
tinea
pedis.
Above
image
is
onychomycosis.
USMLE
can
show
you
this
image
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“oral
terbinafine
for
12
weeks.”
You
don’t
have
to
memorize
that
6
weeks
is
for
fingernails
and
12
weeks
is
for
toenails.
I’m
just
saying
what
the
answer
can
show
up
as,
where
all
the
others
are
clearly
wrong.
Oral
terbinafine
is
classic
for
onychomycosis
because
it
has
a
unique
ability
to
concentrate
in
keratinous
tissues.
Topical
terbinafine,
in
contrast,
is
used
for
tinea
pedis
(or
topical
-azoles).

Yeast
are
a
single-celled
fungi
and
reproduce
through
budding.
They
tend
to
be
round
or
oval
in
shape.
Candida
Forms
pseudohyphae.
This
detail
for
whatever
reason
is
HY.
Hyphae
are
multicellular
structures
formed
by
mold
(a
form
of
fungus).
However ,
candida
is
a
yeast,
not
a
mold,
so
the
structures
it
forms
look
like
hyphae,
but
they’re
not,
hence
pseudohyphae.
The
image
is
HY:
Skin
infections
with
Candida
tend
to
occur
opportunistically
–
i.e.,
in
diabetics,
immunocompromised
patients,
or
those
receiving
ongoing
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
(e.g.,
for
endocarditis).
In
contrast,
dermatophyte
infections
tend
to
occur
sporadically
in
immunocompetent
patients.
Persistent
skin
infections
can
occur
in
those
with
T
cell
dysfunction
or
deficiency .
Chronic
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
is
a
T
cell
dysfunction
disorder .
The
USMLE
will
give
a
17-year-old
girl
who’s
had
candidal
skin
infections
since
birth,
and
then
the
answer
will
just
be
“impaired
cell-mediated
immunity .”
The
answer
can
also
just
be
“T
cell”
for
which
cell
that’s
fucked
up.
Diabetes
causes
dysglycemia,
which
is
a
major
risk
factor
for
candidal
skin
infections,
as
well
as
vulvovaginal
candidiasis.
This
is
because
persistently
elevated
glucose
can
weaken
the
immune
system
(i.e.,
impair
neutrophil
and
macrophage
function).
In
addition,
candida
likes
high-glucose
environments,
so
persistent
glycosuria
supports
growth.
And
high
glucose
also
facilitates
candidal
biofilm
production
and
growth
on
mucosal
surfaces.


--- Page 59 ---

USMLE
will
give
an
obese
woman
with
diabetes
who
has
a
moist,
red
plaque
underneath
one
of
her
breasts
+
they
ask
for
biggest
risk
factor
–>
answer
=
diabetes,
where
obesity
is
wrong.
When
both
answers
are
listed
together ,
choose
diabetes
(or
dysglycemia).
Obesity
is
only
an
indirect
risk
factor
in
that
it
leads
to
insulin
resistance
and
dysglycemia,
so
the
latter
is
the
direct
risk
factor .
Treatment
for
candidal
skin
infections
is
topical
or
oral
-azole.
You
also
need
to
be
aware
of
diaper
rash,
which
can
be
caused
by
candida.
The
USMLE
might
show
you
reddish
maculopapular
clusters
in
the
groin
of
a
baby ,
and
the
answer
is
Candida
.
Systemic
candidal
infections
can
occur
in
those
receiving
total
parenteral
nutrition
(TPN;
hyperalimentation),
since
a
central
venous
line
can
become
colonized
and
TPN
contains
glucose.
Systemic
infections
can
also
occur
in
those
with
neutropenia
(agranulocytosis).
Vulvovaginal
(and
penile,
albeit
more
rare)
candidiasis
is
treated
with
oral
fluconazole
or
topical
nystatin.
USMLE
will
give
you
an
easy
vignette
where
they
describe
thick
white
discharge
per
vaginum
(buzzy
for
candida),
or
they’ll
say
there’ s
vulvovaginal
erythema
and
itchiness,
without
saying
there’ s
discharge,
and
then
show
you
the
image
of
the
pseudohyphae,
and
then
they’ll
ask
the
MOA
of
the
oral
agent
to
be
prescribed
–>
answer
=
“Inhibition
of
P-450-mediated
demethylation,”
which
refers
to
fluconazole.
-Azoles
inhibit
14α-
demethylase,
which
blocks
the
conversion
of
lanosterol
to
ergosterol
(fungal
equivalent
of
cholesterol
in
the
cell
membrane).
Oropharyngeal
candidiasis
(oral
thrush)
can
be
seen
in
immunocompromised
patients,
but
it
is
also
seen
in
asthma
patients
who
use
inhaled
corticosteroids
(e.g.,
fluticasone).
Patients
must
rinse
their
mouths
out
with
water
following
inhaled
corticosteroids,
otherwise
oropharyngeal
mucosal
immunity
can
be
weakened.
Oral
thrush
presents
as
white
plaques
on
the
palate
or
tongue
that
bleed
when
scraped
off.
Treatment
for
oral
thrush
is
nystatin
mouthwash.
Nystatin
pokes
holes
in
the
ergosterol
cell
membrane.
Oropharyngeal
candidiasis
is
not
to
be
confused
with
candidal
esophagitis,
which
always
occurs
in
immunocompromised
patients.
Odynophagia
(pain
with
swallowing)
in
an
immunocompromised
patient
is
candidal
esophagitis
till
proven
otherwise.
Endoscopy
will
show
white
streaks.
Treatment
is
oral
fluconazole.
In
contrast,
herpes
esophagitis
will
show
punched-out
ulcers.
CMV
esophagitis
will
show
linear/confluent
ulcers.

Cryptococcus
neoformans
Demonstrates
narrow-based
budding.
The
N’s
go
together
–
i.e.,
N
arrow-based
budding
for
C.
n
eoformans
.
This
is
in
contrast
to
B
lastomycosis
,
which
is
B
road-based
budding.
Causes
fungal
meningitis
in
immunocompromised
patients
(usually
AIDS).
CSF
analysis
will
show
low
glucose,
high
protein,
and
high
lymphocytes.
High
opening
pressure
can
sometimes
be
seen
with
fungal
meningitis
and
may
be
suggestive,
although
it
is
not
specific,
so
do
not
use
it
as
confirmatory
when
you
are
reading
vignettes.
Latex
agglutination
testing
of
the
CSF
is
most
accurate,
although
India
ink
prep
and
mucicarmine
staining
are
also
often
done.
The
India
ink
prep
is
a
spot-diagnosis
for
C.
neoformans
.
There
is
a
black
background,
where
the
only
thing
that
doesn’t
stain
dark
is
the
halo-like
polysaccharide
capsule
of
C.
neoformans
.


--- Page 61 ---

Mucicarmine
staining
is
red.
You
don’t
have
to
be
a
pathologist.
The
vignette
might
give
you
an
IV
drug
user
with
fever ,
stiff
neck,
and
photophobia
(i.e.,
meningitis
symptoms)
+
they
show
you
this
stain,
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“
C.
neoformans
,”
or
“amphotericin
B”
as
the
treatment.
Amphotericin
B,
similar
to
nystatin,
pokes
holes
in
the
ergosterol
membrane.
It
is
hard-hitting
and
used
for
CNS
and
disseminated
fungal
infections.
For
example,
if
a
patient
has
a
simple
fungal
pneumonia,
he
or
she
might
receive
oral
fluconazole.
But
if
a
patient
has
fungemia
with
rigors,
chills,
and
high
fever
(implying
serious
systemic
infection),
then
amphotericin
B
is
used.
Pneumocystis
jirovecii
Causes
bilateral
pneumonia
(
Pneumocystis
jiroveciii
pneumonia;
PJP)
in
immunocompromised
patients
(usually
HIV/AIDS).
Can
sometimes
be
described
as
“ground-glass,”
although
this
descriptor
is
only
seen
in
a
minority
of
Qs.
A
HY
point
about
PJP
is
that
it
is
specifically
bilateral.
If
the
vignette
gives
you
an
HIV
patient
with
a
lobar
pneumonia,
the
answer
is
S.
pneumo
,
not
PJP.
Students
get
this
wrong
all
of
the
time,
where
they
choose
PJP
in
an
AIDS
patient
with
a
lobar
pneumonia,
and
then
they’re
somehow
flummoxed
that
they
got
it
wrong.
Comes
in
at
a
CD4
count
of
200
in
HIV/AIDS.
Prophylaxis
and
treatment
is
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX).
As
I
talk
about
in
the
HIV
section
of
the
RNA
viruses
–
Part
II
module
,
TMP/SMX
is
also
the
prophylaxis
for
Toxoplasmosis,
although
the
treatment
for
Toxo
is
instead
sulfadiazine
and
pyrimethamine.
What
USMLE
loves
to
do
is
give
you
a
patient
with
a
low
CD4
count
(e.g.,
47)
who
has
ring-enhancing
lesion
of
the
brain
who
is
taking
HAAR T
and
TMP/SMX.
The
diagnosis
is
primary
CNS
lymphoma,
not
Toxo.
And
the
way
we
know
Toxo
is
wrong
is
because
the
patient
is
on
TMP/SMX,
which
is
the
prophylaxis
for
both
Pneumocystis
and
Toxo.
So
commencing
TMP/SMX
at
a
CD4
count
of
200
for
PJP
is
“two
birds
with
one
stone”
by
the
time
the
patient
gets
to
CD4
of
100,
which
is
when
Toxo
comes
in.
It’s
only
patients
who
aren’t
on
TMP/SMX
by
the
time
they
fall
to
CD4
of
100
who
get
Toxo.
PJP
is
diagnosed
with
bronchoalveolar
lavage
(after
the
CXR
shows
bilateral
ground-glass
pneumonia),
which
is
when
sterile
saline
is
injected
into
the
lungs
via
a

--- Page 62 ---

bronchoscope
and
then
aspirated/collected
for
examination.
Pneumocystis
is
classically
visualized
as
oval
yeast
on
silver
stain.
Malassezia
furfur
Causes
tinea
versicolor ,
which
is
an
extremely
buzzy
and
pass-level
spot-diagnosis
on
USMLE.
This
is
a
fungal
infection
of
the
shoulder
blades,
back,
and
upper
torso
that
tends
to
occur
in
sub-tropical
or
tropical
areas,
where
the
patient
presents
with
spotty
hypopigmentation.
The
hypopigmentation
is
due
to
fatty
acid
degradation
within
the
skin,
which
releases
an
acidic
product
by
the
fungus
that
inhibits
tyrosinase
(enzyme
necessary
for
melanin
synthesis).
The
vignette
will
give
a
24-year-old
male
who
frequently
goes
surfing
in
Florida
+
they
show
you
the
buzzy
image:
Then
the
answer
is
just
“topical
selenium,”
which
is
extremely
HY
as
the
treatment.
Malassezia
furfur
can
also
cause
seborrheic
dermatitis
(aka
dandruf f),
which
is
a
fungal
infection
of
the
scalp,
hairline,
and
sometimes
face.
It
presents
as
an
itchy,
flaky
scalp
in
someone
with
otherwise
no
observable
cutaneous
findings,
or
more
severely
as
a
scaly ,
erythematous
hairline
with
weaping
papules.
Occasionally
it
affects
the
face
itself.
This
is
not
to
be
confused
with
tinea
capitis,
which
instead
presents
as
a
circular
area
of
scaling
alopecia.


--- Page 63 ---

Seborrheic
dermatitis
is
treated
with
selenium
or
-azole
shampoo.
Don’t
confuse
seborrheic
dermatitis
with
seborrheic
keratoses,
which
are
dark,
stuck-on,
greasy
lesions
on
the
faces
of
elderly
and
smokers,
where
they
appear
as

they
can
be

NBME
Q
wants
“biopsy

as
the
answer
for
what
is
most
likely
to
confirm
the

(makes
sense).
Acute

Aspergillosis
(ABP A)
presents
as
respiratory
exacerbation
in
a
patient
with
asthma
or
cystic
fibrosis
who
has
hypersensitivity
to
Aspergillus
antigens.
The
diagnosis
is
easy,
so
the
main
point
is
just
that
you

Classic
textbook
descriptor
of
the
histo
is
“spherules
filled
with
endospores”
(left
image),
although
USMLE
doesn’t
really
give
a
fuck
about
that.
What
they
will
do
is
show
you
the
barrel-shaped
hyphae
(right

in
a
patient
who
lives
in
California
+
ask
you
for
the
diagnosis
–>

=
Coccidiodes
.
I
point
this
out
because,
if
you
know
the
descriptor
“spherules
filled
with
endospores,”
but
then
they
show
you
the
image
on
the
right,
you’re
like
what
the
fuck?
So
it’s
to
my
observation
based
on
the
NBMEs
that
“barrel-shaped
hyphae”
is
more
important
for
Coccidiodomycosis.
Uncomplicated
fungal
pneumonia
is
treated
with
fluconazole.
I
believe
there’ s
a
UWorld
question
floating
around
where
they
have
“no
treatment
necessary”
for
simple
pneumonia
caused
by
Coccidioides
,
but
this
is
garbage
for
USMLE.
You

Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis
(i.e.,

Causes
pulmonary

ulcerative

Sporothrix
schenkii
Causes
rosette-

conidiophores
(spores).
Classically
causes
a
papule
at
the
finger
in
gardeners
following
a
prick
by
a
rose
thorn.
This
is
extremely
buzzy
and
I’d
say
only
mentioned
in
about
1/3
of
vignettes.
The
higher
yield
point
about
sporotrichosis
is
that
it
causes
lymphangitis
(i.e.,
lymphocutaneous
sporotrichosis),
where
it
ascends
to
the
axilla
as
either
an
erythematous
streak,
or
as
erythematous
ulcerative
lesions
on
the
forearm.
What
the
USMLE
will
do
is
show
you
the
above
image
in
guy
who
was

and
then
they
ask
what
is
causing
it
(i.e.,
arteriitis,
phlebitis,
lymphangitis,
etc.),
and
the
answer
is
just
lymphangitis.


--- Page 70 ---

You
should
also
be
aware
tangentially
that
lymphangitis
causing
the
pink
streak
can
also
be
caused
by
general
trauma
and
burns
(i.e.,
it
is
not

48-year-old

drug
user
with
a
CD4
count
of
27
who
has
ring-enhancing
lesion
of
the
brain
who
is
taking
HAAR T
and
TMP/SMX.
Diagnosis?
Primary
CNS
lymphoma,
not
Toxo.
TMP/SMX
is
also
the
prophylaxis
for
Toxoplasmosis,
although
the
treatment
for
Toxo
is
instead
sulfadiazine
and
pyrimethamine.
What
USMLE
loves
to
do
is
give
you
a
patient
with
a
low
CD4
count
(e.g.,
47)
who
has
ring-enhancing
lesion
of
the
brain
who
is
taking
HAAR T
and
TMP/SMX.
The
diagnosis
is
primary
CNS
lymphoma,
not
Toxo.
And
the
way
we
know
Toxo
is
wrong
is
because
the
patient
is
on
TMP/SMX,
which
is
the
prophylaxis
for
both
Pneumocystis
and
Toxo.
So
commencing
TMP/SMX
at
a
CD4
count
of
200
for
PJP
is
“two
birds
with
one
stone”
by
the
time
the
patient
gets
to
CD4
of
100,
which
is
when
Toxo
comes
in.
It’s
only
patients
who
aren’t
on
TMP/SMX
by
the
time
they
fall
to
CD4
of
100
who
get
Toxo.

Malassezia
furfur
causing
tinea
versicolor ,
which
is
an
extremely
buzzy
and
pass-level
spot-diagnosis
on
USMLE.
This
is
a
fungal
infection
of
the
shoulder
blades,
back,
and
upper
torso
that
tends
to
occur
in
sub-tropical
or
tropical
areas,
where
the
patient
presents
with
spotty
hypopigmentation.
The
hypopigmentation
is
due
to
fatty
acid
degradation
within
the
skin,
which
releases
an
acidic
product
by
the
fungus
that
inhibits
tyrosinase
(enzyme
necessary
for
melanin
synthesis).

?
(i.e.,
yeast,

Yeasts,
unicellular ,
reproduce
via

Yeast
are
a

They
tend
to
be
round

14.
What
is
main
drug
used
in
the
treatment
of
Cryptococcal
neoformans
meningitis?
What
is
the
MOA
of
the
drug?
Amphotericin
B.
It
is
hard-hitting
and
used
for
CNS
and
disseminated
fungal
infections.
For
example,
if
a
patient
has
a
simple
fungal
pneumonia,
he
or
she
might
receive
oral
fluconazole.
But
if
a
patient
has
fungemia
with
rigors,
chills,
and
high
fever
(implying
serious
systemic
infection),
then
amphotericin
B
is
used.
Coccidioides
.
Classic
textbook
descriptor
of
the
histo
is
“spherules
filled
with

(left

although
USMLE
doesn’t
really
give
a

about
that.
What
they
will
do
is
show
you
the
barrel-shaped
hyphae
(right

in
a
patient
who
lives
in
California
+
ask

but
then
they
show
you
the

So
it’s
to
my

based
on
the
NBMEs
that
“barrel-shaped

is
more
important
for
Coccidiodomycosis
.

methicillin-sensitive
S.
aureus
;
MSSA)
produces
beta-lactamase.
This
means
penicillin,
amoxicillin,
or
ampicillin
alone
will
usually
not
work
and
are
wrong
treatments.
Oral
amoxicillin
combined
with
clavulanate
(Augmentin),
or
IV
ampicillin
combined
with
sulbactam,
serve
the
purpose
of
covering
S.
aureus,
since
clavulanate
and
sulbactam
are
beta-lactamase
inhibitors,
but
giving
amoxicillin
or
ampicillin
alone
should
be
considered
inadequate
for
covering
Staph.
What
this
means
is,
when
we
treat
S.
aureus
,
we
want
to
give
a
methicillin-class
beta-lactam,
since
these
are
heavily
steric
and
are
beta-lactamase
resistant.
Methicillin
isn’t
given
clinically
because
it
causes
interstitial
nephritis
(eosinophils
in
the
urine
+
rash),
but
oral
dicloxicillin
(not
doxycyline)
and
IV
flucloxacillin
are
frequently
given,
since
these
cover
Staph.
So
for
skin,
we
can
give
oral
dicloxacillin
or
cephalexin
out-patient,
or
IV
flucloxacillin
or
cephazolin
in-patient,
as
these
will
cover
S.
aureus
in
addition
to
Group
A
Strep.
First-generation
cephalosporins,
such
as
cephalexin
and
cephazolin,
are
also
beta-lactamase
resistant
and
are
the
same
as
the
methicillin-class
beta-lactams
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
For
impetigo
only,
USMLE
likes
topical
mupirocin,
but
for
oral
meds,
use
as
per
above.
The
only
other
methicillin-class
beta-lactam
you
need
to
know
for
USMLE
is
nafcillin,
which
is
hard-hitting
and
used
for
confirmed
MSSA
endocarditis.
It
is
also
known
to
cause
interstitial
nephritis.
I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME.
Other
agents
like
cloxacillin,
oxacillin,
etc.,
I’ve
never
seen
show
up
on
NBME,
but
students
get
fanatical
about
listing
off
different
drugs.

--- Page 78 ---

For
USMLE,
they
might
ask
you
why
Staph
is
resistant
to
amoxicillin
but
not
to
cephalexin;
the
answer
is
“production
of
penicillinase,”
or
“production
of
beta-lactamase,”
as
we
said.
If
they
ask
how
MSSA
→
MRSA,
the
answer
is
“altered
penicillin-binding
protein.”
We
know
“production
of
beta-lactamase”
is
wrong
here
because
MSSA
already
produces
beta-lactamase,
so
clearly
that
mechanism
can’t
be
the
reason
why
it
can
become
MRSA.
MRSA
endocarditis
is
treated
with
vancomycin.
Vancomycin,
however ,
has
poor
skin
penetration,
so
if
a
cutaneous
infection
is
caused
by
MRSA,
we
treat
that
with
clindamycin,
doxycycline,
or
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
You
do
not
need
to
memorize
these
latter
three
treatments
and
USMLE
won’t
ask.
I’m
just
saying
as
a
medicine
301-level
tangential
point
that
vancomycin
isn’t
used
for
MRSA
skin
infections.
But
it’s
pass-level
you
know
that
MRSA
endocarditis
is
treated
with
vancomycin.
Empiric
Tx
for
endocarditis
is
vancomycin
(covers
gram-positives,
including
MRSA)
and
gentamicin
(covers
gram-negatives).
There
are
other
regimens,
but
you
should
know
that
one.
Do
blood
cultures
before
antibiotics
(asked
on
2CK
NBME).
Staph
epidermidis
Normal
skin
flora.
Can
cause
infections
of
prostheses,
including
heart
valves
and
joint
replacements.
Vancomycin
+
gentamicin
is
the
normal
empiric
Tx
for
endocarditis.
If
the
patient
has
prosthetic
material
in
the
heart,
add
rifampin.
Staph
saprophyticus
Can
cause
UTIs
leading
to
staghorn
calculi
(aka
struvite,
or
ammonium
magnesium
phosphate
stones),
which
resemble
rams
horns.
This
is
because
it
is
urease
(+),
and
struvite
stones
form
at
high
pH.
Points
about
hemolysis
types:

--- Page 79 ---

Group
A
and
B
Strep
both
refer
to
β-
hemolytic
Strep
(i.e.,
Group
A
and
B
Streps
do
not
equal
α-
vs
β-
hemolytic,
respectively).
β-
hemolysis
means
complete
hemolysis
(clear
zone
of
hemolysis
on
blood
agar).
α-
hemolysis
means
partial
hemolysis
(green
zone
of
hemolysis
on
blood
agar).
γ-
hemolysis
means
no
hemolysis
(no
change
on
blood
agar).
Strep
pyogenes
(Group
A
Strep)
Gram-positive
cocci
in
chains.
Infections
cause
elevation
of
anti-streptolysin
titers.
Causes
Strep
pharyngitis,
scarlet
fever
(strawberry
tongue
+
salmon
pink
body
rash
[due
to
erythrogenic
toxin]),
and
skin
infections
(cellulitis,
erysipelas,
impetigo).
Post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis
(PSGN)
is
a
type-III
hypersensitivity
(immune
complex
deposition)
that
can
occur
following
both
pharyngitis
as
well
as
cutaneous
infections
(i.e.,
it
is
not
just
caused
by
pharyngitis).
It
presents
as
red
urine
(hematuria)
1-3
weeks
following
the
infection.
This
is
not
to
be
confused
with
IgA
nephropathy ,
which
is
red
urine
1-3
days
(not
weeks)
following
a
viral
infection.
In
PSGN,
serum
complement
protein
C3
will
be
decreased.
Rheumatic
heart
disease
is
a
type-II
hypersensitivity
that
only
occurs
following
pharyngitis.
The
immune
system
makes
antibodies
against
the
M-protein
of
S.
pyogenes
that
cross-reacts
(molecular
mimicry)
with
the
mitral
valve
(on
USMLE,
RHD
will
be
mitral
29/30
times).
Penicillin
must
be
given
to
treat
Strep
pharyngitis
to
prevent
rheumatic
heart
disease.
However ,
penicillin
will
not
prevent
PSGN.
In
RHD,
the
patient
will
have
mitral
regurg
acutely ,
followed
by
mitral
stenosis
years
later
after
the
valve
scars
over.
99%
of
mitral
stenoses
are
due
to
history
of
RHD.
Pediatric

on
USMLE,
where
a

can
cause
toxic
shock-like
syndrome
due
to

Strep
agalactiae
(Group
B

Causes
neonatal
meningitis,
pneumonia,
and
sepsis.
Rectovaginal
swabs
performed
in
pregnant
women
at
36
weeks’
gestation
to
determine
whether
intrapartum
IV
penicillin
or
ampicillin
prophylaxis
is
given.
For
2CK/3,
indications
for
GBS
prophylaxis:
●
Positive
swab
at
36
weeks’
gestation.
●
GBS
bacteriuria
at
any
point
in
the
current
pregnancy ,
even
if
successfully
treated.
●
Hx
of
prior
pregnancy
where
there
was
early-onset
GBS
disease
in
the
neonate
(i.e.,
meningitis,
pneumonia,
or
sepsis).
Mere
colonization
(i.e.,
mere
positive
test)
in
a
prior
pregnancy
is
not
an
indication
for
giving
prophylaxis
in
current
pregnancy .
●
If
the
mother ’s
GBS
status
is
unknown
at
parturition,
give
prophylaxis
if
any
one
of
the
following
met:
1)
maternal
fever
>38C;
2)
rupture
of
membranes
>18
hours;
3)
premature
delivery
(<37
weeks).
Neonatal
infections
on
USMLE
will
be
caused
by
GBS,
Listeria
,
or
E.
coli
.
If
they
say
a
neonate
has
an
infection
caused
by
gram-positive
cocci,
the
answer
is
GBS;
if
they
say
gram-positive
rods,
that’s
Listeria
;
if
they
say
gram-negative
rods,
that’s
E.

.
Enterococcus
Gram-positive

The
answer
on
USMLE
for
endocarditis
following
genitourinary
manipulation
(e.g.,
catheterization
or
TURP
for
BPH).

--- Page 81 ---

Treated
with
ampicillin.
If
resistant
to
ampicillin,
we
treat
with
vancomycin.
If
resistant
to
vancomycin
(VRE;
vancomycin-resistant
enterococci),
drugs
such
as
linezolid
or
daptomycin
can
be
used.
USMLE
will
not
assess
the
latter
two
treatments
for
VRE.
The
important
point
is
that
you
are
merely
aware
VRE
is
an
important
nosocomial
pathogen,
same
as
MRSA.
Strep
gallolyticus
/
Strep
infantarius
Formerly
known
as
Strep
bovis,
but
USMLE
is
old
school,
so
it
is
not
a
guarantee
the
nomenclature
has
changed
on
the
exam.
Can
cause
endocarditis
in
the
setting
of
colon
cancer .
Strep
pneumoniae
Gram-positive
diplococci
(don’t
confuse
with
Neisseria
gonorrhea
and
meningitidis
,
which
are
gram-negative
diplococci).
Most
common
cause
of
lobar
pneumonia
and
otitis
media.
Can
also
cause
meningitis
and
sinusitis.
Ultra-HY
as
cause
of
sepsis
in
asplenia
and
sickle
cell
(auto-splenectomy).
USMLE
might
give
chest
infection
in
a
teenager
or
young
adult,
where
they
say
there’ s
right
lower
lobe
dullness
to
percussion.
You
know
that’s
S.
pneumo
.
If
they
give
bilateral
interstitial
infiltrates,
that
is
most
likely
Mycoplasma
.
Pneumonia
discussion
is
lengthy .
You
don’t
want
to
memorize
S.
pneumo
as
the
“most
common”
organism
for
meningitis
because
USMLE
wants
you
to
differentiate
it
from
Neisseria
meningitidis
(meningococcus).
If
they
give
college
dormitories,
military
barracks,
or
close
quarters,
this
suggests
N.
meningitidis
over
S.
pneumo
.
In
addition,
N.
meningiditis
causes
non-blanching
rash
(i.e.,
does
not
turn
white
when
pressed);
this
can
refer
to
purpura
or
ecchymoses.
If
they
mention
a
rash,
the
answer
is
meningococcus,
not
S.
pneumo
.
Meningococcus
also
can
cause
Waterhouse-Friderichsen
syndrome
(bilateral
hemorrhagic
necrosis
of
the
adrenal
cortices,
leading
to
hypotension
non-responsive
to
norepinephrine).
Empiric
Tx
for
community-acquired
pneumonia
(CAP)
is
azithromycin
on
USMLE.

--- Page 82 ---

USMLE
doesn’t
assess
levofloxacin
(respiratory
fluoroquinolone)
for
pneumonia
Tx,
but
you
could
be
aware
that
patients
who’ve
had
antibiotics
in
the
past
3
months,
or
who
have
significant
comorbidities,
sometimes
they
are
upgraded
to
a
respiratory
fluoroquinolone.
But
offline
NBME
8
for
2CK
has
azithromycin
straight-up
as
the
answer .
For
CAP
where
the
patient
is
septic,
ceftriaxone
+/-
vancomycin
is
given.
Ceftriaxone
is
powerful
and
effective
against
S.
pneumo
.
Some
strains
are
developing
resistance,
so
vancomycin
can
be
added
(asked
on
one
2CK
Q).
Meningitis
empiric
Tx
is
ceftriaxone
+
vancomycin.
In
elderly ,
ampicillin
can
be
added.
Empiric
Tx
for
otitis
media
is
penicillin
or
amoxicillin.
Recurrent
otitis
media,
however ,
we
can
add
clavulanate
(Augmentin).
But
initially ,
we
just
give
amoxicillin
or
penicillin
alone
for
otitis
media.
Empiric
Tx
for
sinusitis
is
amoxicillin/clavulanate
(Augmentin).
This
is
because
sinusitis
can
be
caused
by
other
organisms
as
well,
including
S.
aureus
,
so
we
need
expanded
coverage
straight-up.
Patients
with
asplenia
/
sickle
cell
have
increased
risk
of
infections
due
to
encapsulated
organisms.
This
namely
refers
to
S.
pneumo
,
H.
influenzae
type
B,
and
N.
meningitidis
,
which
all
have
polysaccharide
capsules.
This
is
because
encapsulated
organisms
require
opsonization
(with
C3b
or
IgG)
and
phagocytosis
for
clearance,
and
the
spleen
is
where
we
have
50%
of
the
immune
system’ s
reservoir
of
macrophages.
So
if
we
lose
the
spleen,
we
lose
substantial
phagocytic
capacity .
Patients
must
receive
additional
rounds
of
vaccination
against
these
three
organisms.
If
USMLE
asks
which
organism
we
are
most
worried
about
when
we
give
penicillin
prophylaxis
to
sickle
cell
patients
(or
any
asplenia
patient
for
that
matter),
the
answer
is
S.
pneumo
.
Choose
this
answer
over
H.
influenzae
type
B
and
N.
meningitidis,
even
though,
yes,
the
latter
two
are
clearly
important
to
cover
as
well.
For
2CK,
we
vaccinate
against
S.
pneumo
by
giving
PCV20
alone,
OR
by
giving
PCV15
+
PPSV23
months
later.
I
talk
about
this
stuff
in
detail
in
my

1.
What
is
the
mechanism
of
toxic
shock
syndrome
versus
endotoxic
shock?
TSST
toxin
is
a
super-antigen
that
bridges
MHC-II
on
macrophages
with
T-cell
receptor
on
CD4+
T
cells.
Once
the
bridging
has
occurred,
macrophages
release
cytokines.
TNF-
α
causes
hypotension;
IL-1
causes
fever .
Do
not
confuse
this
mechanism
with
endotoxic
shock,
which
is
when
the
lipid
A
component
of
lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)
from

How
is
S.

transmitted
in
hospital?
Humans
can
carry
S.
aureus
within
the
nares
(nostrils).
If
USMLE
asks
about
nosocomial
transmission,
the
answer
is
“carried
within

17.
When
is
Enterococcus
the
answer
for
endocarditis?
The
answer
on
USMLE
for
endocarditis
following
genitourinary
manipulation
(e.g.,
catheterization
or
TURP
for
BPH).
18.
What
is
empiric
Tx
for
meningitis?
Meningitis
empiric
Tx
is
ceftriaxone
+
vancomycin.
In
elderly ,
ampicillin
can
be
added.
19.
What
color
is
S.
aureus
when
it
grows?
Yellow
(“golden
staph”).
USMLE
Q
can
mention
“yellow
crusties”
as
impetigo,
as
an
example.
20.
What
is
most
common
cause
of
septic
arthritis?

--- Page 87 ---

Most
cases
are
S.
aureus
.
If
vignette
explicitly
talks
about
promiscuity
or
gives
cutaneous
papules/pustules,
the
answer
is
Gonorrhea
instead.
21.
What
is
the
mechanism
via
which
MSSA
→
MRSA?
If
they
ask
how
MSSA
→
MRSA,
the
answer
is
“altered
penicillin-binding
protein.”
We
know
“production
of
beta-lactamase”
is
wrong
here
because
MSSA
already
produces
beta-lactamase,
so
clearly
that
mechanism
can’t
be
the
reason
why
it
can
become
MRSA.
90%
of
community
Staph
(i.e.,
methicillin-sensitive
S.
aureus
;
MSSA)
produces
beta-lactamase.
22.
What
is
the
mechanism
for
rheumatic
heart
disease?
What
kind
of
hypersensitivity
is
it?
How
is
it
treated?
Rheumatic
heart
disease
is
a
type-II
hypersensitivity
that
only
occurs
following
pharyngitis.
The
immune
system
makes
antibodies
against
the
M-protein
of
S.
pyogenes
that
cross-reacts
(molecular
mimicry)
with
the
mitral
valve
(on
USMLE,
RHD
will
be
mitral
29/30
times).
Penicillin
must
be
given
to
treat
Strep
pharyngitis
to
prevent
rheumatic
heart
disease.
However ,
penicillin
will
not
prevent
PSGN.
In
RHD,
the
patient
will
have
mitral
regurg
acutely ,
followed
by
mitral
stenosis
years
later
after
the
valve
scars
over.
99%
of
mitral
stenoses
are
due
to
history
of
RHD.

What
is
the
most
common
cause
of
mastitis
in
breastfeeding
women?
How
is
it
treated?
S.
aureus.
Give
oral
dicloxacillin
(not
doxycyline).
This
is
assessed
directly
on
a
2CK
form
(if
you’re
studying
for
Step
1,
just
know
it.
Relax.).
Also,
continue
breastfeeding
through
the
affected
breast.
This
detail
USMLE
cares
about
for
some
reason.
24.
What
is
the
categorization
of
Enterococci?
Gram
(+)
bacteria,
cocci,
catalase
(+),
gamma
hemolytic,
no
hemolysis
on
blood
agar,
yes,
grows
in
6.5%
NaCl
25.
What
does
α,
β,
and
γ
hemolysis
mean?
α-
hemolysis
means
partial
hemolysis
(green
zone
of
hemolysis
on
blood
agar).
β-
hemolysis
means
complete
hemolysis
(clear
zone
of
hemolysis
on
blood
agar).
γ-
hemolysis
means
no
hemolysis
(no
change
on
blood
agar).
26.
What
is
the
categorization
of
Strep
pneumoniae?
Gram
(+)
bacteria,
cocci,
catalase
(-),
alpha
hemolytic,
green
hemolysis
on
blood
agar,
optochin
sensitive
27.
When
is
Strep
bovis
the
answer?

--- Page 89 ---

Strep
gallolyticus/infantarius
(formerly
known
as
Strep
bovis)
can
cause
endocarditis
in
the
setting
of
colon
cancer .
28.
What
is
the
empiric
Tx
for
endocarditis?
Empiric
Tx
for
endocarditis
is
vancomycin
(covers
gram-positives,
including
MRSA)
and
gentamicin
(covers
gram-negatives).
There
are
other
regimens,
but
you
should
know
that
one.
Do
blood
cultures
before
antibiotics.
29.
How
do
we
treat
impetigo?
Topical
mupirocin.
30.
What
is
acute
vs
subacute
endocarditis?
And
which
main
organisms
cause
both?
Acute
–>
no
previous
valve
abnormality;
usual
organism
for
IV
drug
users.
Caused
by
S.
aureus
.
Subacute
endocarditis
(i.e.,
patient
has
previous
valve
abnormality ,
such
as
from
history
of
rheumatic
heart
disease,
or
bicuspid
aortic
valve),
classically
following
a
dental
procedure.
Caused
by
Strep
viridans
(aka
Strep
mitis,
mutans,
sanguinis
).
31.
What
is
scarlet
fever?
What
causes
it?
How
is
it
treated?

--- Page 90 ---

Strawberry
tongue
+
salmon
pink
body
rash
due
to
erythrogenic
toxin
of
Strep
pyogenes.
Treat
with
penicillin.
32.
What
is
the
most
common
cause
of
lobar
pneumonia
and
otitis
media?
Strep
pneumoniae
.
Gram-positive
diplococci
(don’t
confuse
with
Neisseria
gonorrhea
and
meningitidis
,
which
are
gram-negative
diplococci).
33.
What’ s
the
empiric
Tx
for
community-acquired
pneumonia
(CAP)
on
USMLE?
Empiric
Tx
for
community-acquired
pneumonia
(CAP)
is
azithromycin
on
USMLE.
USMLE
doesn’t
assess
levofloxacin
(respiratory
fluoroquinolone)
for
pneumonia
Tx,
but
you
could
be
aware
that
patients
who’ve
had
antibiotics
in
the
past
3
months,
or
who
have
significant
comorbidities,
sometimes
they
are
upgraded
to
a
respiratory
fluoroquinolone.
But
offline
NBME
has
azithromycin
straight-up
as
the
answer .
For
CAP
where
the
patient
is
septic,
ceftriaxone
+/-
vancomycin
is
given.
Ceftriaxone
is
powerful
and
effective
against
S.
pneumo
.
Some
strains
are
developing
resistance,
so
vancomycin
can
be
added
(asked
on
one
2CK
Q).
34.
How
does
post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis
present?
What
kind
of
hypersensitivity
is
it?

--- Page 91 ---

Post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis
(PSGN)
is
a
type-III
hypersensitivity
(immune
complex
deposition)
that
can
occur
following
both
Strep
pyogenes
pharyngitis
as
well
as
cutaneous
infections
(i.e.,
it
is
not
just
caused
by
pharyngitis).
It
presents
as
red
urine
(hematuria)
1-3
weeks
following
the
infection.
This
is
not
to
be
confused
with
IgA
nephropathy ,
which
is
red
urine
1-3
days
(not
weeks)
following
a
viral
infection.
In
PSGN,
serum
complement
protein
C3
will
be
decreased.
35.
What
is
an
important
cause
of
bacterial
pneumonia
following
recovery
from
influenza
viral
illness?
S.
aureus
.
Can
cause
bacterial
pneumonia
following
influenza
infection.
36.
What
does
Strep
viridans
cause?
Cause
subacute
endocarditis
(i.e.,
patient
has
previous
valve
abnormality ,
such
as
from
history
of
rheumatic
heart
disease,
or
bicuspid
aortic
valve),
classically
following
a
dental
procedure;
can
create
limit-dextrins,
which
are
carbohydrate
structures
that
can
adhere
to
heart
valves.
37.
What
is
empiric
Tx
for
otitis
media
and
sinusitis?
Empiric
Tx
for
otitis
media
is
penicillin
or
amoxicillin.
Recurrent
otitis
media,
however ,
we
can
add
clavulanate
(Augmentin).
But
initially ,
we
just
give
amoxicillin
or
penicillin
alone
for
otitis
media.

--- Page 92 ---

Empiric
Tx
for
sinusitis
is
amoxicillin/clavulanate
(Augmentin).
This
is
because
sinusitis
can
be
caused
by
other
organisms
as
well,
including
S.
aureus
,
so
we
need
expanded
coverage
straight-up.
38.
What
is
the
categorization
of
Strep
bovis
(Strep
gallolyticus
/
Strep
infantarius)
?
Gram
(+)
bacteria,
cocci,
catalase
(-),
gamma
hemolytic,
no
hemolysis
on
blood
agar,
no
growth
in
6.5%
NaCl
39.
What
are
the
three
organisms
most
commonly
associated
with
neonatal
infections
(i.e.,
sepsis,
meningitis,
pneumonia)?
Neonatal
infections
on
USMLE
will
be
caused
by
GBS,
Listeria
,
or
E.
coli
.
If
they
say
a
neonate
has
an
infection
caused
by
gram-positive
cocci,
the
answer
is
GBS.
If
they
say
gram-positive
rods,
that’s
Listeria.
If
they
say
gram-negative
rods,
that’s
E.
coli
.
40.
Which
vaccines
do
asplenia
and
sickle
cell
patients
need?
And
why?
Patients
with
asplenia
/
sickle
cell
have
increased
risk
of
infections
due
to
encapsulated
organisms.
This
namely
refers
to
S.
pneumo
,
H.
influenzae
type
B,
and
N.
meningitidis
,
which
all
have
polysaccharide
capsules.
This
is
because
encapsulated
organisms
require
opsonization
(with
C3b
or
IgG)
and
phagocytosis
for
clearance,
and
the
spleen
is
where
we
have
50%
of
the
immune
system’ s
reservoir
of
macrophages.
So
if
we
lose
the
spleen,
we
lose
substantial
phagocytic
capacity .
Patients
must
receive
additional
rounds
of
vaccination
against
these
three
organisms.

--- Page 93 ---

If
USMLE
asks
which
organism
we
are
most
worried
about
when
we
give
penicillin
prophylaxis
to
sickle
cell
patients
(or
any
asplenia
patient
for
that
matter),
the
answer
is
S.
pneumo
.
Choose
this
answer
over
H.
influenzae
type
B
and
N.
meningitidis,
even
though,
yes,
the
latter
two
are
clearly
important
to
cover
as
well.
For
2CK,
we
vaccinate
against
S.
pneumo
by
giving
PCV20
alone,
OR
by
giving
PCV15
+
PPSV23
months
later.
I
talk
about
this
stuff
in
detail
in
my
HY
Pulmonary
PDF.
41.
What
is
the
categorization
of
Strep
pyogenes?
Gram
(+)
cocci,
catalase
(-),
beta
hemolytic,
clear
hemolysis
on
blood
agar,
bacitracin
sensitive
42.
What
is
optochin
used
for?
Distinguishes
S.
pneumo
from
S.
viridans
.
43.
How
do
we
treat
S.
aureus
skin
infections?
And
why.
90%
of
community
Staph
(i.e.,
methicillin-sensitive
S.
aureus
;
MSSA)
produces
beta-lactamase.
This
means
penicillin,
amoxicillin,
or
ampicillin
alone
will
usually
not
work
and
are
wrong
treatments.
Oral
amoxicillin
combined
with
clavulanate
(Augmentin),
or
IV
ampicillin
combined
with
sulbactam,
serve
the
purpose
of
covering
S.
aureus,
since
clavulanate
and
sulbactam
are
beta-lactamase
inhibitors,
but
giving
amoxicillin
or
ampicillin
alone
should
be
considered
inadequate
for
covering
Staph.
What
this
means
is,
when
we
treat
S.
aureus
,
we
want
to
give
a
methicillin-class
beta-lactam,
since
these
are
heavily
steric
and
are
beta-lactamase
resistant.
Methicillin
isn’t
given
clinically
because
it
causes
interstitial
nephritis
(eosinophils
in
the
urine
+
rash),
but
oral
dicloxicillin
(not
doxycyline)
and
IV
flucloxacillin
are
frequently
given,
since
these
cover
Staph.

--- Page 94 ---

So
for
skin,
we
can
give
oral
dicloxacillin
or
cephalexin
out-patient,
or
IV
flucloxacillin
or
cephazolin
in-patient,
as
these
will
cover
S.
aureus
in
addition
to
Group
A
Strep.
First-generation
cephalosporins,
such
as
cephalexin
and
cephazolin,
are
also
beta-lactamase
resistant
and
are
the
same
as
the
methicillin-class
beta-lactams
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
For
impetigo
only,
USMLE
likes
topical
mupirocin,
but
for
oral
meds,
use
as
per
above.
The
only
other
methicillin-class
beta-lactam
you
need
to
know
for
USMLE
is
nafcillin,
which
is
hard-hitting
and
used
for
confirmed
MSSA
endocarditis.
It
is
also
known
to
cause
interstitial
nephritis.
I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME.
Other
agents
like
cloxacillin,
oxacillin,
etc.,
I’ve
never
seen
show
up
on
NBME,
but
students
get
fanatical
about
listing
off
different
drugs.
For
USMLE,
they
might
ask
you
why
Staph
is
resistant
to
amoxicillin
but
not
to
cephalexin;
the
answer
is
“production
of
penicillinase,”
or
“production
of
beta-lactamase,”
as
we
said.
44.
What
is
novobiocin
used
for?
Distinguishes
S.
epidermidis
from
S.
saprophyticus.
45.
How
does
food
poisoning
caused
by
S.
aureus
present?
How
does
one
acquire
it
(i.e.,
what
foods,
etc.)?
Food
poisoning
due
to
heat-stable
pre-formed
toxin
in
meats
or
dairy
products
(i.e.,
creams,
potato
salad)
that
have
been
sitting
at
room
temperature
for
a
while.
Presents
as
vomiting
1-6
hours
after
consumption
(diarrhea
is
+/-).
46.
What
is
the
mechanism
of
Staphylococcal
scalded
skin
syndrome?
Who
gets
it?

--- Page 95 ---

How
does
it
present?
Staphylococcal
scalded
skin
syndrome
(SSSS)
is
caused
by
S.
aureus
exfoliative
toxin.
Seen
in
neonates.
Causes
a
generalized
salmon-pink
rash
and
desquamation
of
palms
and
soles.
47.
What
kind
of
infections
does
Staph
epidermidis
cause?
Normal
skin
flora.
Can
cause
infections
of
prostheses,
including
heart
valves
and
joint
replacements.
Vancomycin
+
gentamicin
is
the
normal
empiric
Tx
for
endocarditis.
If
the
patient
has
prosthetic
material
in
the
heart,
add
rifampin.
48.
What
are
the
most
common
organisms
causing
cellulitis,
erysipelas,
and
impetigo?
How
are
they
treated?
S.
aureus
eclipses
Group
A
Strep
(
Strep
pyogenes
)
for
cellulitis,
as
well
as
for
both
bullous
and
non-bullous
impetigo.
Group
A
Strep
eclipses
S.
aureus
for
erysipelas.
For
skin,
we
can
give
oral
dicloxacillin
or
cephalexin
out-patient,
or
IV
flucloxacillin
or
cephazolin
in-patient,
as
these
will
cover
S.
aureus
in
addition
to
Group
A
Strep.
First-generation
cephalosporins,
such
as
cephalexin
and
cephazolin,
are
also
beta-lactamase
resistant
and
are
the
same
as
the
methicillin-class
beta-lactams
for
all
intents
and
purposes.
For
impetigo
only,
USMLE
likes
topical
mupirocin,
but
for
oral
meds,
use
as
per
above.
Bacillus
cereus
Causes
vomiting
and
diarrhea
following
consumption
of
reheated
rice
/
fried
rice
due
to
germination
of
spores.

--- Page 96 ---

Can
also
cause
eye
infections
post-surgery
(e.g.,
for
cataracts).
What
the
USMLE
will
do
is
tell
you
a
patient
had
recent
eye
surgery
+
now
has
an
infection
caused
by
a
gram-positive
rod,
where
B.
cereus
is
the
only
gram-positive
rod
listed.
This
is
how
you
can
arrive
at
the
answer
(i.e.,
if
you
know
the
taxonomy),
even
if
you
haven’t
heard
of
B.
cereus
causing
an
eye
infection
before.
Bacillus
anthracis
Causes
pulmonary
and
cutaneous
anthrax.
Pulmonary
anthrax
will
be
a
hemorrhagic
mediastinitis.
Cutaneous
anthrax
presents
as
a
black
eschar
with
surrounding
edema.
Anthrax
produces
edema
factor ,
which
functions
as
an
adenylate
cyclase
enzyme,
thereby
increasing
cAMP .
USMLE
will
usually
mention
the
patient
is
a
postal
worker .
They
are
very
buzzy
this
way,
and
I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME.
Anthrax
is
aka
“wool-sorter
disease,”
because
its
spores
can
survive
on
the
dry
hides
of
farm
animals
due
to
their
protein
structure.
Anthrax
is
the
only
organism
with
a
protein
capsule
(poly-D-glutamic
acid).
Clostridium
tetani
Causes
spastic
paralysis.
Tetanus
toxin
of
Clostridium
tetani
inhibits
presynaptic
SNARE
protein,
resulting
in
decreased
release
of
presynaptic
neurotransmitters
GABA
and
glycine,
which
are
normally
inhibitory .
Can
present
as
opisthotonos
(arched
back)
and
trismus
(lock-jaw).
Presents
in
two
patients
on
USMLE:
1)
neonate
born
at
home
whose
umbilical
cord
was
cut
with
a
kitchen
knife
+
tied
with
twine;
2)
random
dude
who
cut
himself
in
back
yard.
DTaP
given
at
2,
4,
6,
months,
then
again
at
15-18
months,
then
again
at
4-6
years.

--- Page 97 ---

School-age
kids
require
booster
at
11-12
years,
followed
by
booster
every
10
years
thereafter .
Pregnant
women
should
get
DTaP
at
27-36
weeks
to
protect
neonate
from
pertussis.
For
cuts/wounds
post-vaccine:
●
0-5
years
post-vaccine:
no
Tx
is
necessary .
●
6-9
years
post-vaccine:
if
clean
wound:
no
Tx;
if
dirty
wound:
give
Td
booster .
●
10+
years
post-vaccine:
if
clean
wound:
give
Td
booster;
if
dirty
wound:
IVIG
+
vaccine.
●
In
other
words,
only
ever
give
IVIG
if
it’s
a
dirty
wound
+
has
been
10+
years.
Tetanus
is
a
toxoid
vaccine
(inactivated
toxin/protein).
Clostridium
botulinum
Causes
flaccid
paralysis.
Botulin
toxin
of
Clostridium
botulinum
inhibits
presynaptic
SNARE
protein,
resulting
in
decreased
release
of
presynaptic
acetylcholine,
which
is
normally
stimulatory
at
muscles.
Can
present
as
floppy
baby
syndrome;
can
also
cause
cranial
nerve
palsies.
USMLE
can
be
weird
about
the
answer ,
where
I’ve
seen
them
write
on
an
NBME
exam
something
along
the
lines
of
“prevents
acetylcholine
from
binding
to
its
receptor”
as
the
MOA
of
the
toxin,
even
though
this
isn’t
technically
the
direct
effect.
Acquired
as

honey
in
infants
under
1;
acquired
as
pre-formed
toxin
from
canned
goods
in
anyone
older .
NBME
exam
wants
you
to
know
that
administering
the
toxin
does
not
change
the
effect
of
strength
of
the
effect
of
acetylcholine
binding
to
its
receptor .
This
is
because
the
toxin
isn’t
a
competitive
inhibitor
+
only
decreases
endogenous
ACh
release;
this
has
no
impact
on
any
ACh
administered
exogenously .
Clostridium
difficile

--- Page 98 ---

Diarrhea
(pseudomembranous
colitis)
~7-10
days
after
commencing
oral
antibiotics.
Antibiotics
kill
off
normal
bowel
flora,
allowing
C.
difficile
to
overgrow .
C.
difficile
is
not
normal
flora,
however .
It
is
acquired
via
consumption
of
spores.
USMLE
doesn’t
care
about
which
antibiotics
per
se
cause
pseudomembranous
colitis;
you
just
need
to
know
any
antibiotics
in
general
can
technically
cause
it
if
the
patient
has
been
inoculated
with
spores
prior.
But
you
could
be
aware
that
clindamycin
is
a
classic
agent
known
to
increase
risk,
since
it
is
a
very
powerful
agent
that
essentially
deletes
your
GI
flora,
leaving
C.
diff
without
competition
for
growth.
Can
be
watery
or
bloody
diarrhea
on
NBME.
Can
also
cause
LLQ
cramping
(not
RLQ
as
with
Yersinia
,
which
causes
pseudo-appendicitis).
There
is
NBME
Q
where
they
say
28-year-old
with
LLQ
cramping
and
bloody
diarrhea
7
days
after
starting
oral
antibiotics
–>
answer
=
C.
diff
;
wrong
answer
is
Yersinia.
Diagnose
with
stool
AB
toxin
test;
stool
culture
is
wrong
answer.
If
toxin
test
is
already
performed,
if
they
ask
how
to
further
confirm
the
diagnosis,
the
answer
is
colonoscopy .
Never
perform
colonoscopy
if
a
patient
has
toxic
megacolon
(which
is
possible
with
C.
diff
).
Toxic
megacolon
will
present
as
fever
and
distended
abdomen,
often
with
SIRS
vitals
(means
abnormal
vitals).
Do
abdominal
x-ray
to
diagnose
toxic
megacolon.
Treat
with
oral
vancomycin.
Vancomycin
has
poor
oral
bioavailability ,
so
is
given
IV
for
things
like
endocarditis
and
meningitis.
But
for
C.
diff
infection,
that’s
a
good
thing
because
we
want
it
to
stay
within
the
GI
tract.
If
USMLE
asks
why
vancomycin
is
given
orally
for
C.
diff
,
the
answer
can
be
something
like
“has
poor
oral
bioavailability ,”
which
on
the
surface
sounds
like
a
bad
thing
when
reading
answer
choices,
but
as
I
already
said,
this
is
favorable
when
we
are
treating
C.
diff
.
Other
fancy
Abx
like
fidaxomicin,
rifaximin,
etc.,
I’ve
never
seen
on
NBME.
Clostridium
perfringens

--- Page 99 ---

Causes
watery/secretory
diarrhea
following
consumption
of
poultry.
Causes
gas
gangrene
(CO2
gas)
due
to
production
of
a-toxin/phospholipase;
presents
as
black
skin
/
crepitus
(subcutaneous
emphysema).
Can
also
cause
emphysematous
cholecystitis
(air
in
gall
bladder
wall).
C.
perfringens
is
known
to
be
associated
with
necrotizing
fasciitis,
which
is
deep
infection
along
fascial
planes.
I
reiterate
that
crepitus
is
HY.
If
the
question
specifically
tells
you
that
there
is
no
crepitus
+
the
infection
started
from
some
sort
of
scratch
or
puncture
wound,
the
answer
will
be
Group
A
Strep
or
S.
aureus
instead.
Listeria
monocytogenes
Can
be
described
as
gram-positive
rod
with
tumbling
motility .
Can
grow
at
very
low
temperatures
(i.e.,
0-4
degrees
C).
USMLE
will
say
neonate
who
has
pneumonia,
meningitis,
or
sepsis
caused
by
gram-positive
rod
(if
gram-positive
coccus,
that’s
GBS;
if
gram-negative
rod,
that’s
E.
coli
).
Can
be
acquired
by
pregnant
women
via
deli
meats
and
soft
cheeses.
Can
cause
some
obscure
condition
called
granulomatosis
infantiseptica,
which
presents
as
black
skin
lesions
in
the
neonate.
Corynebacterium
diphtheriae
Causes
diphtheria,
which
presents
in
unvaccinated
or
immigrant
children
as
a
grey
pseudomembrane
in
the
posterior
oropharynx.
I’ve
seen
this
grey
pseudomembrane
detail
show
up
in
one
Q
that
wasn’t
diphtheria,
but
the
association
is
9/10
times
diphtheria.
Can

Question
35
What
is
the
taxonomy/categorization
of
Clostridium
perfringens
?
●
Answer
:
Gram-positive
rod.
It’s
pass-level
to
know
that
Neisseria
are
gram-negative
diplococci.
Don’t
confuse
with
Strep
pneumo
,
which
is
gram-positive
diplococci.
Neisseria
meningitidis
The
answer
on
USMLE
for
cause
of
meningitis
in
three
groups:
1)
College-age
students
living
in
close
quarters
or
military
barracks;
2)
Child
or
older
who
has
non-blanching
rash
(means
doesn’t
turn
white
when
pressure
applied);
can
be
described
as
purpuric
or
ecchymotic;
3)
Patient
with
terminal
complement
deficiency ,
where
there
is
Hx
of
recurrent
gonoccocal
or
meningococcal
disease
in
family
member
or
patient.
Terminal
complement
deficiency
(C5-9),
aka
“total
hemolytic
complement
deficiency”
(seen
NBME
write
it
like
this),
causes
recurrent
Neisserial
infections.
Waterhouse-Friderichsen
syndrome
is
bilateral
hemorrhagic
necrosis
of
the
adrenal
cortices
secondary
to
meningococcal
septicemia.
This
can
present
with
or
without
meningitis.
The
USMLE
might
show
you
a
picture
of
a
purpuric
rash
on
a
child
+
low
BP.

--- Page 109 ---

The
key
point
about
WFS
is
that
cortisol
is
low.
Cortisol
normally
helps
maintain
basal
BP
by
upregulating
alpha-1
receptors
on
peripheral
arterioles.
This
allows
norepinephrine
and
epinephrine
to
bind
(i.e.,
“cortisol
is
permissive
of
the
effects
of
catecholamines”)
and
constrict
arterioles.
In
the
setting
of
WFS,
giving
saline
+
vasopressors
(such
as
norepinephrine)
won’t
work,
since
the
underlying
glucocorticoid
(cortisol)
isn’t
there.
So
the
USMLE
wants
hydrocortisone
as
the
pharmacologic
treatment
after
normal
saline.
N.
meningitidis
is
encapsulated.
This
means
there
is
increased
risk
of
infection
in
those
with
asplenia
/
sickle
cell.
Encapsulated
organisms
require
opsonization
(with
C3b
or
IgG)
and
phagocytosis
for
clearance,
and
the
spleen
is
where
we
have
50%
of
the
immune
system’ s
reservoir
of
macrophages.
So
if
we
lose
the
spleen,
we
lose
substantial
phagocytic
capacity .
Patients
must
receive
additional
rounds
of
vaccination
against
these
three
organisms.
If
USMLE
asks
which
organism
we
are
most
worried
about
when
we
give
penicillin
prophylaxis
to
sickle
cell
patients
(or
any
asplenia
patient
for
that
matter),
the
answer
is
S.
pneumo
.
Choose
this
answer
over
H.
influenzae
type
B
and
N.
meningitidis,
even
though,
yes,
the
latter
two
are
clearly
important
to
cover
as
well.
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae
Causes
STI
with
mucopurulent
discharge;
this
may
progress
to
pelvic
inflammatory
disease
(PID)
in
females,
with
 increased
risk
of
ectopic
pregnancy
due
to
scarring
of
Fallopian
tubes.
There
will
be
gram-negative
diplococci
on
light
microscopy .
In
contrast,
Chlamydia
will
not
show
any
organisms
on
LM.
So
if
we
see
the
gram-negative
diplococci,
we
always
co-treat
for
Chlamydia.
In
other
words,
if
the
gram-(-)
diplococci
are
seen
under
LM,
there’ s
no
way
to
know
if
Chlamydia
is
also
there
or
not
since
the
latter
shows
no
organisms,
so
if
a
patient
has
Gonorrhea
,
the
proper
Tx
is
IM
ceftriaxone
(for
gonococcus),
PLUS
either
oral
azithromycin
or
doxycycline
(for
Chlamydia
).
If
patient
develops
PID
despite
having
been
treated
early
with
ceftriaxone
for
Gonorrhea
,
the
answer
for
why
this
happened
can
be
“Hx
of
improper
antibiotic
treatment,”
where
the
patient
was
supposed
to
be
co-treated
for
Chlamydia
with
azithromycin
or
doxy
but
was
only
given
the
ceftriaxone
for
Gonorrhea.

--- Page 110 ---

If
patient
presents
with
PID
who’s
septic
(i.e.,
high
fever ,
tachy ,
high
WBCs),
USMLE
wants
“admit
to
hospital
+
IV
antibiotics,”
not
the
outpatient
combo
of
IM
+
oral
antibiotics.
2CK
form
assesses
that
if
an
asymptomatic
patient
comes
in
after
a
partner
tested
positive
for
Gonorrhea
or
Chlamydia
,
the
answer
is
give
treatment
without
waiting
for
test
results.
Gonorrhea
doesn’t
cause
reactive
arthritis;
it
causes
gonococcal
arthritis,
which
will
present
one
of
two
ways
on
NBME:
1)
monoarthritis
of
the
knee;
or
2)
triad
of
mono-
or
polyarthritis
+
cutaneous
papules/pustules
+
tenosynovitis
(inflammation
of
tendon
sheaths;
stems
like
to
give
deQuervain
tenosynovitis).
Reactive
arthritis
(usually
caused
by
Chlamydia
),
in
contrast,
presents
as
triad
of
urethritis,
polyarthritis,
and
conjunctivitis.
Rarely
it
can
be
caused
by
GI
infections.
But
the
point
is
that
reactive
arthritis
is
not
caused
by
Gonococcus.
The
latter
causes
gonococcal
arthritis,
which
presents
as
per
above.
Treat
gonococcal
arthritis
same
as
urethritis
–>
ceftriaxone
+
azithro
or
doxy,
since
the
patient
may
also
carry
Chlamydia
.
Gonococcus
is
notoriously
difficult
to
culture
in
patients
who
have
arthritis
but
no
overt
urethritis.
That
is,
the
patient
may
have
a
negative
arthrocentesis
and
throat/urethral
swabs.
So
the
diagnosis
of
arthritis
is
often
made
clinically .
If
the
Q
mentions
papules/pustules
on
the
skin,
this
makes
it
hyper-obvious
for
Gonorrhea
.
I
mention
this
because
occasionally
an
NBME
Q
will
say
the
arthrocentesis
is
negative,
and
this
somehow
confuses
students.
But
arthrocentesis
is
not
very
sensitive
for
organisms
in
the
setting
of
septic
arthritis.
This
can
apply
to
S.
aureus
as
well
(I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME),
but
false-negative
results
for
gonococcus
are
notably
common,
so
don’t
be
thrown
off
by
that.
Can
cause
ophthalmia
neonatorum
(fancy
way
of
saying
neonatal
conjunctivitis).
Gonococcal
conjunctivitis
will
present
in
the
first
week
of
life
with
yellow
discharge
from
the
eye(s).
Chlamydia
tends
to
present
after
the
first
week.
The
USMLE
vignette
will
be
vague,
where
the
student
says,
“But
how
are
we
supposed
to
know
it’s
not
Chlamydia
,
just
because
it’s
first
week
of
life,
that’s
it?”
And
my
response
is:
if
they
give
you
Chlamydia
ophthalmia
neonatorum,
they’ll
always
tie
it
to

--- Page 111 ---

subsequent
pneumonia
somehow ,
since
that
is
such
a
HY
point.
You
need
to
be
aware
that
Chlamydia
drains
through
the
nasolacrimal
duct
down
into
the
lungs,
so
if
they
give
you
a
3-week
old
with
pneumonia
following
conjunctivitis,
you
know
that’s
Chlamydia
.
Prophylaxis
for
gonococcal
conjunctivitis
is
erythromycin
ointment;
treatment
in
the
neonate
is
IM
3
rd
-gen
cephalosporin
(usually
cefotaxime
in
peds).
Prophylaxis
for
chlamydial
conjunctivitis
is
treatment
of
the
mother
while
pregnant;
treatment
in
the
neonate
is
oral
erythromycin.
Same
as
with
N.
meningitidis
,
patients
have
increased
risk
of
infection
with
terminal
complement
(C5-9)
deficiency .
Sometimes
the
vignette
can
give
a
patient
with
recurrent
N.
gonorrhoeae
or
N.
meningitidis
+
ask
what
is
likely
deficient,
and
the
answer
can
simply
be
“C7”
or
“C8.”
Seems
weird/out
of
place,
but
it’s
easy
if
you
know
terminal
complement
deficiency
is
exceedingly
HY
for
Neisserial
infections.
A
vaccine
cannot
be
made
against
N.
gonorrhoeae
because
it
has
pilus
proteins
on
its
cell
surface
that
undergo
antigenic
variation.
This
is
in
contrast
to
N.
meningitidis
,
where
we
make
a
vaccine
against
the
polysaccharide
capsule.
N.
gonorrhoeae
,
however ,
does
not
have
a
capsule.
Haemophilus
influenzae
You
need
to
be
aware
of
H.
influenzae
type
B
as
well
as
non-typeable.
H.
influenzae
type
B
(HIB)
causes
epiglottitis
and
meningitis.
H.
influenzae
non-typeable
is
a
less
common
cause
of
otitis
media
(compared
to
S.
pneumo
)
and
can
also
cause
pneumonia
in
COPD.
I’ve
never
seen
it
assessed
on
NBME
as
the
answer
for
otitis
media,
but
I’m
letting
you
know
that
occasionally
you
might
read
about
H.
influenzae
being
a
cause
of
otitis
media
after
S.
pneumo
.
But
this


--- Page 112 ---

refers
to
H.
influenzae
non-typeable,
not
type
B.
I’ve
seen
one
Q
only
on
NBME
of
H.
influenzae
non-typeable
pneumonia
in
a
COPD
patient.
HIB
has
a
polysaccharide
capsule.
The
vaccine
is
a
conjugate
vaccine,
where
a
protein
is
attached
to
the
polysaccharide
capsule
so
that
it
can
be
expressed
on
MHC-II.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
that
T-independent
antigens
are
non-proteinaceous
(i.e.,
polysaccharide
capsules,
LPS
of
gram-negatives,
etc.)
and
therefore
cannot
be
expressed
on
MHC-II
molecules.
Therefore,
by
attaching
a
protein
to
it
(e.g.,
flagellin),
it
can
be
expressed
on
MHC-II
and
presented
to
CD4+
T
cells
for
a
more
robust
immune
response.
This
vaccine
point
is
HY
for
immuno
for
USMLE.
Epiglottitis
is
seen
in
unvaccinated
and
immigrants
(can
be
unvaccinated),
as
well
as
patients
with
asplenia
or
sickle
cell
(auto-splenectomy).
X-ray
of
neck
shows
“thumbprint
sign.”
Presents
as
child
who
has
fever
+
difficulty
breathing.
They
can
say
the
kid
is
drooling
and/or
in
tripod
positioning
(facilitates
use
of
accessory
muscles).
USMLE
wants
intubation
as
immediate
answer .
Epiglottitis
is
a
medical
emergency
that
can
lead
to
sudden
occlusion
of
the
airway .
Antibiotic
Tx
following
intubation
=
3
rd
-gen
cephalosporin
(cefotaxime
in
peds,
or
ceftriaxone);
give
rifampin
to
close
contacts.
Legionella
Classically
acquired
via
aerosols
from
air
conditioners.
The
question
can
simply
say
“residential
facility”
or
“business
trip”
to
imply
exposure
to
large
AC
units.
If
the
Q
gives
Legionella
pneumonia
+
they
ask
about
acquisition,
the
answer
can
be
“environmental
aerosols.”
Cause
of
atypical
pneumonia
(interstitial
pneumonia),
with
bilateral
interstitial
infiltrates.
“Legionnaire’ s
disease”
refers
to
severe
pneumonia/illness
due
to
Legionella
.
Can
also
cause
hyponatremia
and
diarrhea.
Diagnosed
with
urine
antigen
test.

--- Page 113 ---

Treat
with
azithromycin
or
doxycycline.
Mycoplasma
Most
common
bacterial
cause
of
atypical
pneumonia
(interstitial
pneumonia).
Viruses
are
technically
most
common,
but
for
USMLE,
if
a
patient
has
a
bilateral
pneumonia
with
interstitial
infiltrates,
Mycoplasma
is
the
likely
cause.
Referred
to
as
“walking
pneumonia,”
which
refers
to
a
young,
healthy
adult
who’s
literally
been
walking
around
but
who
has
a
dry
cough
+
low-grade
fever ,
where
the
CXR
shows
bilateral
infiltrates.
There
is
an
NBME
Q
that
literally
trolls
the
concept
of
walking
pneumonia,
where
they
say
a
23-year-old
male
was
hiking
for
8
hours
the
day
before
+
has
a
pneumonia,
and
the
answer
is
Mycoplasma
.
In
general,
you
need
to
be
aware
that
lobar
pneumonia
is
usually
S.
pneumo
,
and
bilateral
pneumonia
is
usually
Mycoplasma
(in
AIDS
patients,
bilateral
pneumonia
is
Pneumocystis
).
There
is
one
NBME
Q
that
gives
right
lower
lobe
interstitial
infiltrates,
with
Mycoplasma
as
the
correct
answer ,
where
S.
pneumo
isn’t
listed.
This
means
the
word
“interstitial”
wins
over
location.
Can
cause
cold
agglutinins
(IgM
antibodies
against
RBCs),
leading
to
hemolysis.
In
other
words,
bilateral
pneumonia
+
low
Hb
=
Mycoplasma
.
High
LDH
can
also
sometimes
be
seen.
RBCs
are
packed
with
LDH,
so
high
LDH
on
USMLE
is
often
their
way
of
saying
hemolysis.
Treat
with
azithromycin
or
doxycycline.
HY
for
Step
1
NBMEs:
they
will
ask
why
beta-lactams
such
as
amoxicillin
are
ineffective
against
Mycoplasma
.
The
answer
is
because
it
lacks
a
peptidoglycan
cell
wall.
Chlamydia
Obligate
intracellular .
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
(not
Chlamydia
trachomatis)
is
technically
another
cause
of
interstitial/atypical
pneumonia
after
Mycoplasma
and
Legionella
,
but
I’ve
never
seen
this
assessed
on
NBME.

--- Page 114 ---

Chlamydia
psittaci
is
a
cause
of
atypical
pneumonia
in
bird
owners
or
those
who
work
at
a
pet
store
with
birds.
Treat
with
azithromycin
or
doxycycline.
Chlamydia
trachomatis
D-K
(the
actual
STI)
can
cause
pneumonia
in
neonates
following
conjunctivitis.
This
is
HY.
The
Q
will
give
a
3-week-old
who
had
conjunctivitis
1-2
weeks
earlier ,
who
now
has
low-grade
fever
+
bilateral
wheezes.
The
labs
can
show
a
high
%
of
lymphocytes,
since
Chlamydia
lives
intracellularly
so
requires
cell-mediated
immunity
to
clear
it.
In
contrast,
other
organisms,
like
S.
pneumo
,
which
live
outside
the
cell,
cause
a
neutrophilic
shift
instead,
since
neutrophils
are
used
for
humoral
immunity .
Prophylaxis
for
Chlamydia
neonatal
conjunctivitis
is
treating
the
mom
while
pregnant.
Treatment
in
the
neonate
is
oral
erythromycin.
Topical
is
wrong
because
it
will
not
kill
what
has
already
entered
the
nasolacrimal
duct.
Topical
erythromycin
is
used
as
prophylaxis
for
gonococcal
conjunctivitis;
Tx
for
the
latter
is
cefotaxime.
Bordetella
pertussis
Classic
whooping
cough
presents
as
succession
of
many
coughs
followed
by
an
inspiratory
stridor .
What
you
need
to
know
for
USMLE
is
that
this
can
absolutely
present
in
an
adult
and
that
they
can
be
vague
about
it,
just
describing
it
as
a
regular
cough.
There
is
an
NBME
Q
where
they
give
pertussis
in
a
19-year-old,
and
I
see
students
confused
thinking
it
must
be
a
kid.
This
is
not
the
case.
Write
a
letter
to
NBME
if
you
disagree.
The
way
you’ll
know
it’s
pertussis,
however ,
is
they
will
say
there’ s
hypoglycemia
and/or
post-tussive
emesis,
which
means
vomiting
after
coughing
episodes.
Pertussis
can
cause
super-high
WBC
counts
in
the
30-50,000-range,
where
there
are
>80%
lymphocytes.
This
is
called
reactive
lymphocytosis.
This
makes
it
resemble
ALL.
So
you
should
know
for
Peds
that
ALL-like
laboratory
findings
+
cough
=
pertussis.
Q
will
ask
number-one
way
to
prevent
–>
answer
=
vaccination
(not
hard,
but
they
ask
it).
Pertussis
is
part
of
TDaP .
The
pertussis
component
is
killed-acellular;
the
tetanus
and
diphtheria
are
toxoid.

--- Page 115 ---

Erythromycin
can
be
given
to
patients
with
active
cough;
USMLE
doesn’t
give
a
fuck
about
pertussis
stages.
Close
contacts
should
also
receive
erythromycin.
Francisella
tularensis
Cause
of
atypical
pneumonia
in
patients
with
exposure
to
rabbits.
Can
sometimes
cause
ulcerated
skin
lesions.
Infection
is
called
tularemia.
Rickettsia
Refers
to
a
genus
of
bacteria
that
are
obligate
intracellular
(same
as
Chlamydia
,
which
is
also
obligate
intracellular).
Rickettsia
rickettsii
causes
Rocky
Mountain
spotted
fever
(RMSF),
which
is
a
palms
and
soles
rash
(sometimes
the
Q
can
say
wrists/ankles
instead
of
palms/soles)
that
migrates
toward
the
trunk
(centripetal
rash).
RMSF
is
considered
a
form
of
vasculitis
and
is
spread
by
dermacentor
wood
tick.
It
is
treated
with
doxycycline.
“Typhus”
refers
to
rash
+
fever+
headache
conditions
caused
by
rickettsia.
Rickettsia
prowazekii
causes
epidemic
typhus;
spread
by
louse.
Rickettsia
typhi
causes
endemic
typhus;
spread
by
fleas.
Rickettsia
tsutsugamushii
causes
scrub
typhus;
spread
by
mites.
Rickettsia
cause
a
positive
Weil-Felix
test,
which
means
there
are
positive
titers
to
Proteus-O
antigen.
Sounds
weird,
but
I
don’t
know
what
to
tell
you.
Coxiella
burnetii

--- Page 116 ---

Causes
Q-fever ,
an
atypical
pneumonia
in
those
with
exposure
to
farm
animals,
especially
cattle.
Was
once
considered
a
type
of
Rickettsia,
but
has
now
been
recategorized
into
its
own
genus.
It
is
Weil-Felix
negative.
Brucella
Acquired
from
unpasteurized
goat
products
(i.e.,
cheese,
milk).
Brucellosis
causes
undulating
fever ,
which
presents
as
afternoon
fevers
and
normal
body
temperature
in
the
morning.
Invasion
to
the
CNS
is
called
neurobrucellosis,
which
can
present
as
meningoencephalitis.
Pasteurella
multocida
Can
cause
skin
infection
following
a
cat
or
dog
bite.
Bartonella
henselae
Can
cause
skin
infection
following
cat
or
dog
scratch
(hence
cat-scratch
disease).
Causes
non-caseating
granulomatous
inflammation
seen
on
silver
stain.
The
Q
need
not
say
the
patient
has
a
pet.
NBME
might
say
there
is
an
8-year-old
girl
with
a
papule
on
the
finger ,
where
biopsy
shows
granulomatous
inflammation
on
silver
stain,
and
the
answer
is
simply
Bartonella
henselae
.
Treat
with
azithromycin.
Can
cause
bacillary
angiomatosis
in
immunocompromised
patients,
which
is
proliferating
blood
vessels
presenting
as
raised,
red/violaceous
skin
lesions.
The
condition
is
known
to
resemble
Kaposi
sarcoma.

Serratia
marcescens
Cause
of
nosocomial
UTIs;
urease-positive;
can
lead
to
struvite
(ammonium
magnesium
phosphate;
staghorn)
calculi,
since
these
form
at
higher
pH.
Grows
cherry
red
on
culture
medium.
Catalase-positive.
Serratia
sepsis
can
be
mentioned
on
USMLE
in
patients
with
NADPH
oxidase
deficiency
(chronic
granulomatous
disease),
since
these
patients
have
susceptibility
to
catalase-positive
organisms
(Big
SPACES
–>
Burkholderia,
S.
aureus
,
Pseudomonas
,
Aspergillus
,
E.
coli
,
Serratia
).
Escherichia
coli
Most
common
cause
of
UTIs,
cystitis,
and
pyelonephritis.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
fimbriae
or
P-pilus
are
virulence
factors
that
enable
adhesion
to
urothelium.
Causes
prostatitis
and
epididymitis
in
males
40s
and
older
(NBME
gives
male
who’s
45
with
prostatitis
where
E.
coli
is
correct
and
Chlamydia
is
wrong).

--- Page 124 ---

Increased
risk
of
infections
in
patients
with
NADPH
oxidase
deficiency
(because
E.
coli
is
catalase-positive).
ETEC
Enterotoxigenic
E.
coli
(ETEC)
causes
traveler ’s
diarrhea,
which
is
self-limiting
watery
or
brown-green
diarrhea
following
trips
overseas
to,
e.g.,
Mexico
or
the
Middle
East.
Classically
acquired
via
water
or
lettuce
contaminated
with
human
feces.
The
mechanism
for
ETEC
diarrhea
is
heat-labile
toxin
that
ADP-ribosylates
adenylyl
cyclase,
increasing
cAMP ,
as
well
as
heat-stabile
toxin
that
ADP-ribosylates
guanylyl
cylase,
increasing
cGMP .
In
other
words,
HL
toxin
increases
cAMP;
HS
toxin
increases
cGMP .
The
HL
toxin
increasing
cAMP
is
the
same
mechanism
as
cholera
toxin
(
Vibrio
cholerae
);
the
difference
is
cholera
causes
profuse,
high-volume
stool,
with
liters
and
liters
of
rice-water
stool,
wheres
traveler ’s
diarrhea,
even
if
it
is
described
as
occurring
8-12
times
daily
(I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME),
they
will
not
describe
it
as
profusely
high-volume
the
way
cholera
presents.
The
HS
toxin
increasing
cGMP
is
the
same
mechanism
as
Yersinia
enterocolitica
toxin.
The
difference
is
the
latter
causes
bloody
diarrhea
and
pseudo-appendicitis
(RLQ
pain)
or
arthritis,
whereas
traveler ’s
diarrhea
is
not
bloody .
EHEC
O157:H7
Enterohemorrhagic
E.
coli
(EHEC)
causes
bloody
diarrhea
(dysentery)
in
isolation,
or
can
also
cause
full-blown
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS).
Classically
acquired
from
beef.
HUS
presents
as
triad
of:
1)
thrombocytopenia;
2)
hemolytic
anemia
with
schistocytes;
and
3)
renal
insuf ficiency
with
or
without
hematuria.
The
combination
of
thrombocytopenia
+
schistocytosis
=
microangiopathic
hemolytic
anemia
(MAHA).

--- Page 125 ---

The
mechanism
for
HUS
is:
E.
coli
EHEC
O157:H7
(and
Shigella
)
both
secrete
toxins
(Shiga-like
toxin
and
Shiga
toxin,
respectively)
that
cause
inflammation
of
renal
microvasculature
–>
ADAMTS13
protein
inactivation
–>
failure
of
cleavage
of
vWF
multimers
–>
platelet
adherence
to
vascular
endothelium
cannot
be
as
readily
reversed
–>
platelet
aggregations
protrude
into
vascular
lumen
causing
shearing
of
RBCs
flying
past
–>
fragmentation
of
RBCs
(schistocytes,
aka
helmet
cells).
Shiga-like
and
Shiga
toxins
cleave
the
eukaryotic
60S
ribosomal
subunit,
thereby
interfering
with
protein
translation.
Klebsiella
Urease
(+);
can
cause
struvite
stones.
Can
cause
cavitary
pneumonia
with
currant
jelly
(thick,
dark
red)
sputum;
classically
seen
in
alcoholics
or
those
with
aspiration
risk.
Proteus
Urease
(+);
can
cause
UTIs
leading
to
struvite
stones,
same
Klebsiella
and
Serratia
.
Salmonella
Causes
food
poisoning
(
Salmonella
enteritidis
and
typhimurium
),
resulting
in
bloody
diarrhea.
Acquired
from
consumption
of
poultry
or
eggs,
as
well
as
from
interaction
with
reptiles
(i.e.,
pet
lizards,
snakes,
etc.).
Salmonella
typhi
causes
typhoid
fever ,
which
is
high
fever
+
prostration
(patient
is
lying
down
ill
/
in
pain)
+
rose
spots
on
the
abdomen
+
either
constipation
or
diarrhea.
Humans
are
the
reservoir
for
Salmonella
typhi
,
and
it
is
acquired
via
fecal
contaminated
food/water .
It
can
remain
latent
in
the
gall
bladder .
Shigella
Acquired
from
beef.

--- Page 126 ---

Can
cause
shigellosis,
which
is
isolated
bloody
diarrhea
(dysentery),
or
can
cause
full-blown
HUS
(same
as
EHEC,
as
discussed
above).
Requires
inoculation
with
relatively
few
organisms
to
cause
infection
(in
comparison
to
Salmonella
,
which
requires
more
organisms
to
cause
infection).
Shiga-toxin
cleaves
the
eukaryotic
60S
ribosome
(same
as
EHEC),
but
its
main
virulence
factor
is
its
ability
to
invade
GI
mucosa.
If
Shigella
loses
its
ability
to
invade,
it
is
severely
impeded
in
its
ability
to
cause
infection.
EHEC
does
not
invade.
Pseudomonas
Causes
pneumonia
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients.
I’ve
talked
about
in
prior
content
that
S.
aureus
exceeds
Pseudomonas
prior
to
age
10
and
that
Pseudomonas
exceeds
S.
aureus
after
age
10.
But
I’m
not
convinced
that
USMLE
gives
a
fuck.
I’m
not
going
to
go
fish
for
and
remove
that
detail
about
age
from
my
prior
content,
however .
Can
cause
infections
on
burns.
Appears
blue-green
due
to
a
pigment
it
produces
called
pyocyanin.
If
a
burn
has
a
yellow
color ,
in
contrast,
this
is
likely
S.
aureus
(“
golden
Staph
),
not
Pseudomonas.
Diabetic
patients
have
increased
general
infection
risk
due
to
Pseudomonas
.
This
notably
is
in
reference
to
osteomyelitis
and
foot
ulcers.
However ,
a
caveat
is
that
a
new
NBME
Q
for
2CK
has
“polymicrobial”
as
the
answer
for
the
most
likely
cause
of
diabetic
foot
ulcer ,
where
both
Pseudomonas
and
S.
aureus
are
wrong
answers.
I
mention
this
because
resources
over
the
years
have
pushed
Pseudomonas
for
foot
ulcers.
So
I
just
want
you
to
be
aware
“polymicrobial”
is
correct
if
it’s
listed
alongside
Pseudomonas
.
Pseudomonas
is
very
important
cause
of
nosocomial
pneumonia
(i.e.,
hospital-
and
ventilator-acquired
pneumonia).
If
a
patient
has
a
nosocomial
pneumonia
(which
is
defined
as
a
pneumonia
starting
>48
hours
following
becoming
an
in-patient),
he
or
she
must
receive
coverage
for
both
MRSA
as
well
as
Psuedomonas.
This
is
accomplished
by
giving
vancomycin
(covers
MRSA)
PLUS
either
ceftazidime
(a
3rd-gen
ceph)
or
cefepime
(a
4th-gen
ceph).
Ceftriaxone
(a
3rd-gen
ceph)
does
not
cover
Pseumonas
,
so
the
combo
of
vanc
+
ceftriaxone
is
wrong
for
nosocomial
infections.
This
combo
is
used
for
community-acquired
sepsis
or
meningitis.
For
community-acquired
pneumonias
where
there
is
not
sepsis,
we
give
simple
azithromycin
to
treat.

--- Page 127 ---

There
are
other
agents
that
cover
Pseudomonas
,
such
as
carbapenems,
pipericillin/tazobactam,
amikacin
(an
aminoglycoside),
etc.,
but
I
have
not
seen
NBME
assess
these.
What
I
have
seen
that
is
incredibly
HY
on
forms
is
the
vancomycin
+
cephalosporin
combos
as
I
mentioned
above.
Pseudomonas
can
cause
otitis
externa
(swimmer ’s
ear)
and
hot
tub
folliculitis.
Treat
otitis
externa
with
topical
ciprofloxacin
+
hydrocortisone
drops.
Prophylaxis
for
otitis
externa
(e.g.,
in
someone
who
does
crew
who
can’t
avoid
water
exposure)
is
topic
alcohol-acetic
acid
drops.
Answers
such
as
ear
plugs
are
wrong.
Carbamide
peroxide
drops
are
for
earwax
buildup
(distractor
on
NBME).
Pseudomonas
produces
a
toxin
that
inhibits
Elongation
Factor
2
(EF2),
same
as
Diphtheria
.
Vibrio
Vibrio
cholerae
(cholera)
presents
as
“liters
and
liters”
of
rice-water
stool
in
someone
who
went
traveling
to,
e.g.,
Mexico.
Acquired
fecal-oral
(i.e.,
fecal-contaminated
food/water).
MOA
of
toxin
is
same
as
ETEC
heat-labile
toxin
causing
traveler ’s
diarrhea,
which
is
ADP-ribosylation
of
adenylyl
cyclase
(increases
cAMP).
The
way
you
can
differentiate
this
from
ETEC
traveler ’s
diarrhea
is
that
cholera
is
notably
profusely
high-volume.
Both
ETEC
and
cholera
vignettes
can
tell
you
the
patient
has
8-12
stools
daily,
so
it’s
not
the
#
of
stools
that
matters;
it’s
the
emphasis
on
volume.
Cholera
causes
death
via
severe
dehydration
and
electrolyte
disturbance.
Tx
is
oral
rehydration
on
USMLE;
if
patient
has
low
BP
or
altered
mental
status
(i.e.,
confusion/coma),
IV
hydration
is
done.
Vibrio
parahemolyticus
doesn’t
cause
profuse,
watery
diarrhea
the
same
way
cholera
does.
I’ve
seen
this
organism
asked
once
in
an
NBME
vignette
where
the
patient
ate
sushi
(can
be
acquired
from
sushi
and
shellfish).

--- Page 128 ---

Vibrio
vulnificus
causes
severe
sepsis
in
half
of
patients.
This
is
asked
on
offline
NBME
19
where
a
dude
went
running
on
a
beach
and
got
sepsis,
with
no
mention
of
consumption
of
food.
But
it’s
apparently
acquired
from
shellfish.
Yersinia
Causes
bloody
diarrhea
+
either
appendicitis-like
(i.e.,
RLQ)
pain
or
arthritis.
The
RLQ
pain
is
from
mesenteric
adenitis
or
terminal
ileitis.
Toxin
has
same
MOA
as
ETEC
heat-stabile
toxin
(i.e.,
 
ADP-ribosylates
guanylyl
cylase,
thereby
increasing
cGMP).
There
is
an
NBME
Q
where
they
tell
you
a
patient
was
on
antibiotics
for
a
week
+
has
bloody
stool
+
LLQ
pain,
and
the
answer
is
C.
diff
,
not
Yersinia
.
C.
diff
can
cause
either
watery
or
bloody
stool,
and
sometimes
pain.
Pseudo-appendicitis
due
to
Yersinia
will
be
RLQ;
it
will
not
be
LLQ.
Helicobacter
pylori
Spiral-shaped
gram-negative
rod.
Responsible
for
almost
all
duodenal
ulcers
(>95%),
whereas
it
causes
a
lower
%
(only
>60%)
of
gastric
ulcers.
This
is
merely
because
the
latter
are
caused
by
many
other
things
as
well,
so
we
simply
have
decreased
fraction
caused
by
H.
pylori.
In
other
words,
there’ s
no
special
tropism
of
H.
pylori
toward
duodenal
over
gastric
mucosa.
Mechanism
for
ulcers
that
shows
up
on
USMLE
is:
“secretes
proteinaceous
substrates
that
damage
mucosal
lining.”
This
is
correct
over
“ increases
gastric
acid
secretion”
if
both
are
listed
side-by-side,
even
though
H.
pylori
does
 
gastrin
levels,
which
 increases
acid
secretion.
Produces
urease,
which
causes
 increased
ammonia
production
around
the
organism,
allowing
it
to
survive
in
the
decreased
pH
of
the
stomach.
Antral/pyloric
ulcers
can
lead
to
gastric
outlet
obstruction.
They
will
mention
this
on
NBME
as
a
“succussion
splash.”

--- Page 129 ---

Increased 
risk
of
MALT
lymphoma,
a
type
of
B-cell
lymphoma;
can
be
obstructive
at
the
pylorus,
as
well
as
at
the
cardia
of
the
stomach
adjacent
the
lower
esophageal
sphincter .
Diagnose
H.
pylori
with
urease
breath
test
or
stool
antigen.
Endoscopy
+
biopsy
can
be
performed
to
confirm
diagnosis
in
some
cases
via
visualization
of
the
spiral-shaped
organisms.
Treat
H.
pylori
with
CAP
–
i.e.,
clarithromycin,
amoxicillin,
PPI
(e.g.,
omeprazole).
USMLE
really
doesn’t
give
a
fuck
about
the
treatment,
but
CAP
is
safe
to
know .
Metronidazole,
tetracycline,
bismuth,
and
PPI
tetrad
is
used
if
CAP
fails
(students
ask
about
those
other
drugs).
Perforated
duodenal
ulcer
will
present
as
sudden-onset
rigid
abdomen
(involuntary
guarding).
Patient
will
often
have
SIRS,
with
abnormal
vitals
due
to
sympathetic
activation.
USMLE
wants
“X-rays
of
the
chest
and
abdomen”
to
look
for
air
under
the
diaphragm
(HY
finding
that
indicates
ruptured
viscus).
Campylobacter
jejuni
Bloody
diarrhea
1-3
days
after
consumption
of
poultry.
Can
cause
Guillain-Barre
syndrome
(ascending
paralysis
+
decreased
tendon
reflexes
+
albuminocytologic
dissociation
in
the
CSF
–>
Tx
with
IVIG
+
plasmapheresis).
I
would
say
only
about
1/4
of
GBS
Qs
will
mention
any
type
of
preceding
infection.
So
don’t
rely
on
the
dude
going
to
some
BBQ
or
getting
diarrhea
beforehand
as
a
crutch
for
GBS
Qs.
Grows
best
at
high
temperatures
(42
degrees).
Bacteroides
Normal
GI
flora
for
mouth
to
anus.
Most
important
detail
is
that
it
is
strictly
anaerobic.
Anaerobic
infections
on
USMLE
can
present
as
“foul-smelling
sputum”
or
“foul-smelling
discharge.”

--- Page 130 ---

Causes
pulmonary
abscess
and
aspiration
pneumonia.
USMLE
wants
“aspiration
of
oropharyngeal
normal
flora,”
or
“aspiration
of
oropharyngeal
anaerobes”
as
the
cause
of
pulmonary
abscess.
Oropharyngeal
normal
flora
=
Bacteroides
(strictly
anaerobic
gram-negative
rods);
as
well
as
Peptostreptococcus
and
Mobiluncus
.
The
latter
two
are
not
HY,
but
Bacteroides
is.
I
mention
all
three,
however ,
because
the
Q
can
say
sputum
sample
shows
“gram-negative
rods,
gram-positive
cocci,
and
gram-positive
rods,”
which
refers
to
all
three.
But
the
bigger
picture
concept
is,
this
=
mixed
normal
flora.
Q
will
give
aspiration
risk
factor ,
such
as
alcoholism,
dementia
(can
cause
loss
of
gag
reflex),
Hx
of
stroke
(leading
to
dysphagia),
or
epilepsy .
Q
can
also
mention
broken
or
missing
teeth
(hypodontia)
as
risk
factor .
Pulmonary
abscess
is
often
described
on
NBME
as
pulmonary
lesion
with
an
air-fluid
level.
This
is
buzzy ,
but
not
a
mandatory
descriptor .
This
refers
to
the
top
half
of
the
circle
being
air,
and
the
bottom
being
pus,
the
latter
settling
due
to
gravity .
Tx
for
pulmonary
abscess
=
clindamycin
.
Clindamycin
is
used
for
“anaerobes
above
the
diaphragm”
(metronidazole
for
“anaerobes
below
the
diaphragm”).
Some
students
have
asked
about
potentially
updated/alternative
pharm
for
pulmonary
abscess,
but
I
can
tell
you
clindamycin
is
all
over
2CK
NBMEs.
Additionally ,
USMLE
can
give
some
sort
of
abdominal
infection
(e.g.,
after
surgery),
where
the
site
drains
“foul-smelling
sputum.”
You
know
right
away
they’re
talking
about
anaerobes,
specifically
Bacteroides
.
What

Points
about
pharm:
Nematode
infections
on
USMLE
are
basically
always
treated
with
-bendazoles
(i.e.,
mebendazole,
albendazole,
etc.).
These
are
microtubule
inhibitors.
Don’t
confuse
with
-azoles
(antifungals).
Pyrantel
pamoate
is
another
agent
that
can
be
used
for
nematodes,
but
lower
yield.
Diethylcarbamazine
is
non-existent.
Ivermectin
is
an
odd-one
out
used
for
Onchocerca
volvulus
(discussed
below).
Praziquantel
is
used
for
cestodes
and
trematodes.
This
causes
worm
paralysis.
In
short,
mebendazole
and
praziquantel
are
the
two
highest
yield
anti-helminth
agents
for
USMLE.
It
is
extremely
rare
USMLE
lists
more
than
one
anti-helminthic
agent
as
answers
to
a
question.
Usually
the
Q
is
very
easy,
where
the
answer
is
the
only
anti-helminthic
listed.
But
there
are
a
couple
questions
out
there
where
they
list
a
-bendazole
and
praziquantel
side
by
side.
So
you
must
know
that
mebendazole
is
used
for
nematodes;
praziquantel
is
used
for
cestodes
and
trematodes.
HY
point
about
bloods:
Eosinophils
can
classically
be
elevated
in
helminth
infections.
This
is
because
eosinophils
play
a
role
in
killing
helminths
via
release
of
major
basic
protein.
Normally

--- Page 134 ---

eosinophils
should
be
<5%.
In
helminth
infections,
they
can
be
>6-8%.
Questions
where
eosinophils
are,
e.g.,
15-20%
would
be
considered
flamingly
obvious
and
pass-level.
Eosinophils
can
occasionally
be
elevated
in
fungal
infections
as
well,
so
don’t
be
confused
by
this.
In
other
words,
although
eosinophilia
is
classically
associated
with
helminth
infections,
just
be
aware
this
is
not
100%
specific
and
it
can
occasionally
be
seen
with
fungal
infections
too.
For
the
following
helminths,
the
USMLE
can
give
a
vignette
where
you
are
easily
able
to
diagnose
the
organism,
but
then
they
ask
how
it’s
acquired,
where
they
have
answers
such
as
“ingestion
of
fecal-contaminated
soil,”
“through
the
feet,”
“mosquito
bite,”
“fly
bite,”
etc.,
and
the
answer
is
the
former .
Even
if
the
“fecal-contaminated
soil”
part
sounds
weird,
it
might
be
the
only
answer
that
involves
ingestion,
which
you
therefore
know
must
be
correct.
Ascaris
lumbricoides
Giant
roundworm.
Infection
is
called
Ascariasis.
Causes
intestinal
obstruction.
USMLE
can
give
vignette
of
patient
with
eosinophilia
with
high-pitched
or
absent
bowel
sounds
(both
findings
that
can
reflect
obstruction),
and
the
answer
is
just
Ascariasis
or
Ascaris
lumbricoides
.
Not
dramatic.


--- Page 135 ---

Treat
with
mebendazole.
Enterobius
vermicularis
Aka
pinworm
(asked
on
USMLE,
where
student
got
easy
vignette
+
all
of
the
worms
listed
were
colloquialisms
rather
than
actual
binomial
nomenclature).
Causes
perianal
itching.
Diagnosed
via
Scotch
tape
test,
where
eggs
around
the
anal
verge
can
be
collected
using
tape.
Treat
with
mebendazole.
Toxocara
canis
Carried
by
pet
dogs.
Acquired
through
ingestion
of
contaminated-soil/food.
Causes
visceral
larva
migrans,
which
can
cause
hepatosplenomegaly .
Treat
with
mebendazole.
Trichinella
spiralis
Acquired
from
pork
and
bear
meat
consumption.
Trichinosis
presents
as
triad
of
1)
fever ,
2)
myalgias,
and
3)
periorbital
edema
in
patient
who
ate
bear
meat
or
pork.
Treat
with
mebendazole.

--- Page 136 ---

Strongyloides
stercoralis
Invades
usually
through
the
feet.
Travels
through
the
bloodstream
to
the
lungs,
causing
pulmonary
symptoms.
The
larvae
ascend
the
trachea
and
are
then
swallowed
into
the
GI
tract,
where
they
cause
abdominal
symptoms.
USMLE
will
give
you
school-age
girl
in
rural
Louisiana
(I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME)
who
has
pulmonary
and
abdominal
symptoms
+
worms
isolated
from
the
GI
tract
+
they
ask
for
the
mode
of
transmission
–>
answer
=
“through
the
feet.”
Treat
with
mebendazole.
Hookworms
Ancylostoma
duodenale
and
Necator
americanus
are
hookworms.
USMLE
loves
these.


--- Page 137 ---

They
enter
through
the
feet
+
travel
to
the
lungs,
same
as
Strongyloides
.
The
difference
is
that
when
they
eventually
enter
the
GI
tract,
they
suck
blood
from
their
site
of
attachment
in
the
small
bowel,
causing
microcytic
anemia
due
to
iron
deficiency .
The
USMLE
will
not
list
Strongyloides
alongside
the
hookworms
as
separate
answers
in
the
setting
of
pulmonary
symptoms.
What
they
will
do
is
give
you
patient
with
eosinophilia
+
microcytic
anemia,
where
the
answer
is
a
hookworm.
Or
they
will
give
helminth
infection
+
pulmonary
symptoms
+
microcytic
anemia,
and
the
answer
is
simply
“through
the
feet,”
or
one
of
the
hookworms
as
the
Dx.
Treat
with
mebendazole.


--- Page 138 ---

Onchocerca
volvulus
Causes
onchocerciasis
(river
blindness).
Transmitted
by
black
fly
and
causes
black
skin
lesions
and
blindness.
Everything
is
Black:
Black
fly,
Black
bite,
Black
eyesight
(blindness).
Will
be
kid
in
South
America
or
Africa
who
has
a
skin
lesion
+
blindness,
where
Onchocerca
volvulus
is
only
helminth
listed
that
causes
blindness.
Treat
with
ivermectin.
Wuchereria
bancrofti
Causes
elephantiasis
(aka
lymphatic
filariasis),
which
is
massive
swelling
due
to
lymphatic
insuf ficiency .
Transmitted
by
female
mosquito.


--- Page 139 ---

Treat
with
mebendazole.
Loa
Loa
Roundworm
that
presents
crawling
in
the
eyeball.
Transmitted
by
deer,
horse,
or
mango
fly.
Treat
with
mebendazole.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
that
tapeworms
have
a
segmented
body
and
a
scolex,
which
refers
to
the
head
of
the
tapeworm
that
has
“suckers
and
hooks.”
USMLE
is
known
to
show
this
image
on
the
real
exam
+
expect
you
to
know
you’re
looking
at
a
tapeworm
because
of
the
characteristic
scolex.


--- Page 140 ---

Diphyllobothrium
latum
Aka
fish
tapeworm.
Acquired
from
ingesting
–
you’d
never
guess
it
–
fish.
Causes
B12
deficiency ,
leading
to
macrocytic
anemia
and
hypersegmented
neutrophils.
This
is
in
contrast
to
hookworms
(
N.
americanus
and
A.
duodenale
;
nematodes),
which
cause
microcytic
anemia.
Treat
with
praziquantel.
Taenia
solium
Aka
pork
tapeworm.
Acquired
from
pork
consumption,
usually
in
someone
who
went
abroad
to,
e.g.,
Mexico.
Causes
cysticercosis,
which
presents
as
muscle
pain/cysts,
and
neurocysticersos,
which
presents
as
lesions
within
the
brain.
The
latter
can
present
one
of
three
ways
on
NBME
(as
per
my
observation):
1)
swiss-cheese
appearance
of
brain
(buzzy);
2)
one
or
two
ring-enhancing
lesions;
3)
cystic,
soap-bubble-appearing
lesions
within
the
ventricles.
I’ve
specified
in
the
past
that
praziquantel
is
preferred
for
cysticercosis
and
albendazole
for
neurocysticercosis
(rare
use
of
a
-bendazole
for
a
non-nematode),
but
USMLE
actually
doesn’t
give
a
fuck,
and
they
won’t
list
both
side
by
side
anyway .
You
should
just
know
that
praziquantel
is
basically
always
the
answer
for
cestodes
and
trematodes,


--- Page 141 ---

but
that
albendazole
(normally
a
nematode
agent)
can
be
used
for
neurocysticercosis.
But
if
you’re
ever
asked
this
on
the
real
exam,
they
will
give
you
obvious
Taenia
solium
infection,
where
the
answer
is
the
only
anti-helminth
drug
listed,
so
there
won’t
be
any
confusion.
Don’t
confuse
Taenia
solium
(pork
cestode)
with
Trichinella
spiralis
(pork/bear
nematode,
which
is
triad
of
1-
periorbital
edema,
2-
myalgias,
3-
fever ,
in
someone
who
ate
pork
or
bear).
Echinococcus
granulosus
Causes
hydatid
cyst
disease.
Presents
with
liver
cysts,
and
sometimes
jaundice
and
general
flu-like
symptoms.
Do
not
biopsy
the
cysts.
This
can
cause
anaphylaxis.
The
correct
management
is
surgical
excision
of
the
cysts
+
praziquantel.
Schistosoma
hematobium
Snails
are
the
reservoir .
But
the
trematode
isn’t
acquired
via
consumption.
It
is
acquired
through
the
skin
in
someone
swimming
in
(usually)
Africa.
Travels
to
the
cystic
veins
draining
the
bladder
+
the
bladder
wall.
Causes
hematuria
and
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
the
bladder .


--- Page 142 ---

USMLE
vignette
will
say
some
guy
was
swimming
in
Africa
+
now
has
hematuria
and
eosinophilia.
The
Q
need
not
ask
about
SCC
of
the
bladder .
This
is
in
contrast
to
smoking,
industrial
(aniline)
dyes,
and
naphthylamine
(moth
balls),
which
cause
transitional
cell
carcinoma
of
the
bladder
and
urothelial
tract.
Treat
with
praziquantel.
Schistosoma
mansoni/japonicum
Same
as
S.
hematobium
,
snails
are
the
reservoir ,
but
the
trematode
isn’t
acquired
via
consumption.
It
is
acquired
through
the
skin
in
someone
swimming
in
(usually)
Africa.
Travels
to
the
mesenteric
veins
/
intestines,
before
making
its
way
to
the
liver.
Can
cause
hepatosplenomegaly ,
liver
damage,
and
GI
symptoms.
There
is
Q
on
NBME
exam
where
they
show
picture
of
a
worm
+
say
there’ s
hepatosplenomegaly ,
and
then
Schistosoma
mansoni
is
the
answer ,
but
it’s
not
a
hard
Q
because
it’s
the
only
reasonable
organism
listed.
Treat
with
praziquantel.
Clonorchis
sinensis.
Acquired
via
consumption
of
contaminated
fish.
Can
cause
cholangiocarcinoma
(bile
duct
cancer).
Treat
with
praziquantel.
Paragonimus
westermani
Acquired
via
consumption
of
crab
meat
or
crayfish.
Travels
from
the
GI
tract
to
the
lungs,
where
it
causes
hemoptysis.
Treat
with
praziquantel.

I’ve
seen
one
NBME
Q
where
the

was
described
as
a
“cystic

even
though
it’s
not
a
cyst
(such
as
with

Acanthamoeba
Causes
keratitis
(inflammation

and
encephalitis.
Naegleria
fowleri
Found
in
contaminated
fresh
water
sources,
i.e.,

--- Page 158 ---

This
is
the
organism
you
see
in
the
news
once
every
6
months
as
“brain-eating
amoeba”
that
causes
death
in
someone
who
swam
in
a

Giardia
lamblia
Acquired
as
cysts
in
fresh

Organisms
that
are
acquired
as
cysts
in
fresh
water
are
ECG
–>
E
ntamoeba
,
C
ryptosporidium
,
G
iardia
.
Causes
steatorrhea
(fatty
stool),
which
can
be
described
as
extremely
foul-smelling
stool
that
floats.
The
patient
can
also
have
bloating.
There
is
one
NBME
Q
for
Giardia
where
they
say
the
patient
has
foul-smelling
watery
diarrhea
and
bloating,
which
is
audacious,
since
Giardia
causes
steatorrhea,
but
the
“foul-smelling”
and
“bloating”
point
toward
steatorrhea
nevertheless.
The
diarrhea
is
malabsorptive,
where
the
patient
can
acquire
nutritional
and
fat-soluble
vitamin
deficiencies.
Has
two
phases
during
its
life
cycle:
trophozoite
(left
image),
which
is
the
actively
reproducing,
motile
(with
8
flagella),
and
infective
phase,
and
the
cyst
(right
image),
which
is
the
dormant,
non-infective
stage.
Both
images
are
exceedingly
HY
spot-diagnoses
for
USMLE.

Patients
with
IgA

Treat
with
metronidazole.
Trichomonas
vaginalis
Causes
trichomoniasis.
Presents
as
yellow-green
discharge.
Can
cause
“strawberry
cervix,”
or
punctate
hemorrhages
on
the
cervix.
If
they
don’t
say
this,
they
can
sometimes
say
yellow-green
discharge
+
a
vaginal
canal
that
is
erythematous.
Flagellated
protozoan.
Diagnosed
via
visualization
on
wet
mount.
Treat
with
metronidazole
for
patient
and
partner
(high
rate
of
reinfection).
Trypanosoma
cruzi
Causes
Chagas
disease,
aka
American
trypanosomiasis.
Spread
by
Reduviid
bug.
It
is
aka
“kissing
bug”
because
of
its
usually
soft,
painless
bite.
Can
cause
Romaña
sign,
which
is
palpebral
(eyelid)
swelling
1-2
weeks
after
infection.
This
occurs
when
T.
cruzi
-containing
feces
from
the
Reduviid
bug
are
rubbed
into
the
eye.
That
is,
the
bite
need
not
occur
on
or
near
the
eye;
the
feces
can
be
transferred
from
a
bite
elsewhere
to
the
eye.


--- Page 160 ---

Can
cause
dilated
cardiomyopathy ,
achalasia,
and
toxic
megacolon.
Treated
often
with
nifurtimox
and
benznidazole.
Trypanosoma
brucei
Causes
African
sleeping
sickness,
aka
African
trypanosomiasis.
Spread
by
Tsetse
fly.
Presents
as
daytime
sleepiness
and
nighttime
insomnia.
Treated
often
with
suramin
and
melarsoprol.
Leishmania
donovani
Causes
Leishmaniasis.
Spread
by
the
Phlebotomus
sand
fly.
USMLE
likes
the
Middle
East
as
location
where
it
is
prevalent.
An
NBME
Q
mentions
a
guy
who
went
to
Iraq.
Can
cause
skin
ulceration
at
bite
site
(cutaneous
leishmaniasis).


--- Page 161 ---

It
can
also
cause
visceral
leishmaniasis
(aka
kala-azar),
which
can
lead
to
pancytopenia
and
hepatosplenomegaly .
Treated
often
with
sodium
stibogluconate.
Sporozoans
have
a
spore-forming
phase
and
are
distinguished
by
the
presence
of
an
apical
complex
at
one
end
of
the
cell,
which
is
used
for
invading
host
cells.
Plasmodium
spp.
Causes
malaria.
Presents
as
flu-like
illness
with
the
development
of
hemolysis
and
varying
fever
patterns.
P.
falciparum
causes
hypoglycemia
and
cerebral
malaria,
which
is
more
fatal.
Transmitted
to
humans
by
the
Anopheles
mosquito
in
regions
of
the
world
such
as
Africa,
South
America,
and
Asia.
Life
cycle:
The
Anopheles
mosquito
injects
the
sporozoite
form
of
malaria
into
the
blood.
The
sporozoites
travel
to
the
liver
and
mature
into
schizonts
within
hepatocytes,
which
undergo
asexual
reproduction
to
produce
merozoites.
A
single
schizont
will
contain
many
merozoites.
This
phase
within
the
liver
is
called
the
hepatic,
or
exo-erythrocytic


--- Page 162 ---

stage
(I’ve
seen
this
on
NBME).
The
schizonts
containing
merozoites
are
then
released
into
the
blood.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
this
schizont
image
on
blood
smear .
Merozoites
then
invade
RBCs
(erythrocytic
phase).
Once
inside
the
RBC,
the
merozoites
mature
into
ring-shaped
trophozoites,
followed
by
new
schizonts
containing
new
merozoites.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
the
ring
form
on
blood
smear .
Then
the
RBCs
periodically
burst,
causing
fever
patterns.
Trophozoites
do
not
develop
prior
to
the
schizonts
in
the
liver.
So
in
short,
the
Anopheles
mosquito
injects
Plasmodium
into
the
host,
then:
Hepatic
(exo-erythrocytic)
stage:
sporozoite
–>
schizont
–>
merozoites
–>
leave
liver.
Erythrocytic
stage:
merozoite
–>
ring-shaped
trophozoite
–>
schizont
–>
merozoites
–>
burst
RBC
(causes
fever).


--- Page 163 ---

As
mentioned
above,
Plasmodium
falciparum
is
the
most
severe
type
and
causes
cerebral
malaria
(neurologic
deficits,
seizures,
headache),
with
greatest
chance
of
death.
The
fever
pattern
is
variable.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
that
patients
with
P.
falciparum
can
get
hypoglycemia
due
to
increased
consumption
of
glucose
by
the
organism.
This
is
an
answer
on
one
of
the
NBME
exams,
where
they
give
a
simple
vignette
of
malaria
and
then
ask
what
is
most
likely
to
be
seen
in
this
patient,
and
the
answer
is
hypoglycemia.
Strikes
students
as
weird,
but
it’s
on
the
NBME.
Chloroquine
can
be
given
as
prophylaxis,
which
inhibits
malarial
heme
polymerase.
However ,
some
regions
have
high
levels
of
chloroquine
resistance,
so
mefloquine
can
be
given
instead.
If
they
tell
you
a
patient
was
given
chloroquine
and
develops
malaria
anyway ,
the
answer
USMLE
wants
is
“pharmacologic
resistance”;
the
wrong
answer
is
“non-compliance
with
medication.”
P.
vivax
and
ovale
cause
tertian
fever
(every
48
hours;
or
every
3rd
day).
They
form
hypnozoites
within
the
liver,
which
is
a
latent
form.
This
is
one
of
the
highest
yield
details
regarding
malaria,
where
they
will
say
a
patient
with
the
disease
was
treated
successfully ,
but
then
months
later
has
a
resurfacing
of
symptoms.
Patients
with
P.
vivax
and
ovale
must
receive
primaquine,
which
kills
hypozoites.
I’ve
seen
the
USMLE
ask
this
numerous
ways.
They
can
ask
for
primaquine
as
the
answer
straight
up.
They
can
ask
why
primaquine
is
given
for
P.
vivax
and
ovale
,
where
the
answer
is
“kills
hypnozoites.”
I’ve
also
seen
“kills
the
exo-erythrocytic
stage.”
P.
malariae
causes
a
more
mild
form
of
malaria
and
a
quartan
fever
(every
72
hours;
or
every
4th
day).
P.
knowlesi
is
found
predominantly
in
southeast
Asia
and
causes
a
quotidian
(daily)
fever .
Malaria
is
diagnosed
with
thick
and
thin
blood
smears.
This
is
asked
on
NBME,
where
“
Plasmodium
antigen
testing”
is
wrong
answer .
Toxoplasma
gondii
Classically
acquired
from
contact
with
infected
cats,
or
via
consumption
of
pork.

--- Page 164 ---

Toxoplasmosis
presents
as
one
or
more
ring-enhancing
lesions
on
CT
of
the
head.
Can
be
in
the
context
of
seizures
and/or
miscellaneous
neurologic
symptoms
as
as
a
result
of
the
CNS
infection.
Patient
need
not
be
immunocompromised,
but
HIV
patients
with
CD4
count
<100
are
at
greater
risk.
Prophylaxis
is
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX),
which
is
the
same
as
that
for
Pneumocystis
jirovecii
at
a
CD4
count
of
200.
So
if
a
patient
with
a
CD4
count
of,
e.g.,
47,
commenced
TMP/SMX
at
CD4
count
of
200
+
has
a
seizure
+
ring-enhancing
lesion,
you
know
the
diagnosis
is
not
Toxo,
since
he/she
is
already
on
prophylaxis.
The
diagnosis
in
this
case
is
primary
CNS
lymphoma
(HY
for
AIDS
under
CD4
count
of
100).
Treatment
for
Toxo
is
sulfadiazine
+
pyrimethamine.
This
is
asked
on
a
2CK
form,
where
they
list
both
TMP/SMX
and
sulfadiazine
+
pyrimethamine;
the
latter
is
correct.
Congenital
Toxo
in
neonates
presents
as
a
triad
of:

Babesia
Spread
by
Ixodes
tick,
same
as
Lyme
disease
(
Borrelia
burgdorferi),
Ehrlichia
,
and
Anaplasma.
Causes
malaria-like
hemolytic
disease
in
patient
who
never
left
the
United
States.
In
contrast,
if
the
patient
left
the
United
States
and
went
to
(usually)
Africa,
the
answer
is
malaria,
not
Babesia
.
Can
cause
a
ring-form
on
blood

similar
to

What
the
USMLE
will
do
is
tell
you
patient
has
fever
+
hemolytic
disease
of
some
kind
+
never
left
the
US
+
show
you
above
image;
they
will
list
both
malaria
and

as
answers
–>
answer
=
babesia.
Even
though
you’re
aware
malaria
can
also
produce
a
similar-appearing
ring-form,
since
the
patient
never
left
the
US,
you
know
it
can’t
be
malaria.
Conversely ,
if
they
show
you
ring-form
and
tell
you
patient
recently
went
to
Africa,
you
know
it’s
malaria,
not
babesia.

Rhinovirus
Most
common
cause
of
common
cold
(i.e.,
upper
respiratory
tract
infection,
with
coryza,
dry
cough,
no
exudates,
and
no
fever).
Nothing
else
you
need
to
know .
Coxsackie
A
Causes
hand-foot-mouth
disease,
which
presents
as
vesicles
on
–
you’d
never
guess
it
–
the
hands,
feet,
and
mouth.
Almost
always
a
pediatric
condition,
but
adults
can
sometimes
get
it
as
well.
Can
also
cause
herpangina,
which
is
oropharyngeal
vesicles.
Coxsackie
B

--- Page 172 ---

Causes
myocarditis
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy .
Can
cause
diabetes
mellitus
type
I
in
susceptible
patients.
The
immune
system
develops
antibodies
against
a
viral
oligopeptide
that
cross-reacts
with
intra-beta-islet
cell
glutamic
acid
decarboxylase-65.
Hence
this
one
of
the
reasons
why
anti-GAD-65
antibodies
are
positive
in
some
patients
with
type
I
DM.
Can
cause
pleurodynia,
which
is
intercostal
muscle
spasm
presenting
with
sharp,
lateral
chest
pain,
sometimes
with
an
increase
in
serum
CK
due
to
the
muscle
spasm.
Despite
its
name,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
lungs
and
is
an
MSK
condition.
It
shows
up
twice
on
the
NBME
content
for
2CK.
For
Step
1,
I’d
still
know
what
it
is.
Echovirus
Common
cause
of
aseptic
(viral)
meningitis.
CSF
analysis
for
viral
meningitis
is:
normal
protein;
normal
glucose;
elevated
lymphocytes.
Poliovirus
Infects
the
anterior
horns
of
the
spinal
cord
and
causes
polio
myelitis
(inflammation
of
spinal
cord).
Classically
causes
degeneration
of
motor
neurons
in
one
leg,
leading
to
one
leg
much
smaller
than
the
other
leg.
Highest
yield
points
about
Polio
actually
have
zero
to
do
with
the
infection
and
almost
all
to
do
with
the
vaccines.
Sal
k
vaccine
=
k
illed
intramuscular .
Sabin
vaccine
=
live-attenuated
oral.
Only
the
live-attenuated
vaccine
is
capable
of
generating
a
CD8+
T-cell
response
and
IgA
secretion
in
the
gut.

--- Page 173 ---

This
is
because
only
live
virus
can
invade
the
cell,
leading
to
expression
on
MHC-I
(which
interacts
with
CD8).
This
occurs
within
the
gut,
since
the
vaccine
is
oral,
so
the
Peyer ’s
matches
in
the
ileum
can
be
stimulated
to
make
gut
IgA.
The
killed
intramuscular
vaccine
can’t
produce
a
CD8+
T
cell
response
because
killed
virus
can’t
invade
the
cell.
And
since
it
doesn’t
have
exposure
to
the
gut,
there
won’t
be
gut
IgA
produced.
USMLE
will
ask
what
is
a
common
feature
of
these
vaccines
that
accounts
for
their
efficacy
–>
answer
=
“neutralizing
antibodies
in
the
circulation.”
Both
the
killed
and
oral
are
capable
of
generating
IgG
antibodies
in
the
circulation.
In
short:
only
Sabin
does
CD8+
response
and
gut
IgA
production;
both
Salk
and
Sabin
produce
IgG
in
circulation.
If
you’re
confused
about
the
immuno,
I
talk
about
this
stuff
in
my
HY
Immuno
PDF
.
Hepatitis
A
The
answer
for
acute
hepatitis
in
the
United
States
most
of
the
time.
The
Q
might
say
the
patient
had
recent
travel
to
Mexico.
Fecal-oral;
only
causes
acute
hepatitis.
ALT
is
usually
>
AST
for
viral
hepatitis.
IgM
against
HepA
means
acute
infection.
IgG
against
HepA
means
patient
has
cleared
infection
(because
there
is
no
chronic
HepA).
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
HepA
vaccine
is
indicated
for
MSM
and
IV
drug
users.
The
latter
in
particular
sounds
weird,
since
HepA
isn’t
parenteral,
but
it’s
asked.
There’ s
a
2CK
NBME
Q
where
they
just
mention
otherwise
healthy
MSM,
and
answer
is
Hep
A
vaccination.
Students
are
confused,
but
I
don’t
know
what
to
tell
you.
Hepatitis
E

--- Page 174 ---

Causes
fulminant
hepatitis
/
  
high
risk
of
death
in
pregnant
women.
Same
as
with
HepA,
only
causes
acute
hepatitis.
Seen
more
in
Asia,
e.g.,
Tibet.
But
if
USMLE
says
Mexico
+
pregnant
woman
+
fast
death
from
hepatitis,
you
still
have
to
use
your
head
and
know
that’s
HepE
over
HepA.
Norovirus
(Norwalk
virus)
Most
common
cause
of
watery
diarrhea
in
adults
and
rotavirus-vaccinated
children.
Cruise
ships
and
business
conferences
are
buzzy
places
to
acquire
(fecal-oral);
basically
any
place
with
high
density
of
people.
If
the
Q
says
a
young
child
+
family
all
have
watery
diarrhea,
the
answer
is
Norwalk,
not
Rota,
since
only
the
young
child
would
get
Rota,
not
the
family
also.
Rotavirus
Most
common
cause
of
watery
diarrhea
in
unvaccinated
children
<
5
years.
Immigrant
status
(e.g.,
from
China)
often
implies
unvaccinated
status
on
USMLE.
Vaccine
normally
given
orally
at
2,
4,
and
6
months
of
age.
Double-stranded,
segmented
RNA
(NBME
asks
it).
Wheel-shaped
(also
asked
on
NBME).
Coltivirus
Causes
Colorado
tick
fever ,
which
is
a
flu-like
illness.
Mostly
occurs
in
Western

Alphavirus

--- Page 177 ---

Causes
some
obscure
brain
infection
in
a
farmer
called
equine
encephalitis.
Asked
maybe
once
on
an
old
NBME
form
somewhere.
Rubella
(aka
German
measles)
Causes
fever
and
head-to-toe
maculopapular
rash
in
unvaccinated
children
(and
adults).
HY
point
about
the
presentation
is
that
it
causes
post-auricular
and
sub-occipital
lymphadenophathy .
Adults
can
get
arthritis.
For
example,
if
the
USMLE
gives
you
a
neonate
with
congenital
rubella
syndrome
+
they
ask
what
symptom
the
woman
most
likely
had
when
pregnant,
arthritis
can
be
an
answer
if
rash
is
not
listed.
USMLE
will
not
force
you
to
choose
between
rash
and
arthritis.
The
point
is
that
you
merely
are
aware
arthritis
is
HY
in
adults
as
part
of
the
presentation.
Congenital
rubella
presents
as
patent
ductus
arteriosus
(PDA)
in
a
neonate.
Exceedingly
HY
/
pass-level.
Cataracts
and
deafness
also
possible.
MMR
vaccine
is
live-attenuated
and
is
contraindicated
during
pregnancy
due
to
theoretical
risk
to
the
fetus.
If
a
woman
inadvertently
receives
the
vaccine
while
pregnant
or
within
the
month
prior
to
pregnancy ,
it
is
not
an
indication
for
abortion,
but
risks
to
the
fetus
are
increased
and
proper
monitoring
is
important.
The
vaccine
is
not
contraindicated
in
HIV.
Literature
says
subjectively
can
be
implemented
in
patients
who
are
severely
immunocompromised
with
consideration
of
CD4
count,
but
there
is
no
specific
CD4
cutof f.
The
point
is,
MMR
vaccine
is
avoided
in
pregnancy ,
but
not
avoided
in
HIV.
Hepatitis
C
Parenteral;
can
be
acute
or
chronic.
Transmitted
almost
exclusively
from
IV
drugs/blood
exposure.
Not
present
in
breastmilk
and
non-sanguineous
body
fluids
(in
contrast
to
HepB).
In
contrast
to
HepB,
HepC
is
not
considered
sexually
transmitted.
Large
longitudinal
study
of
couples
with
one
HepC(+)
partner
showed
sexual
transmission
almost
nil

--- Page 178 ---

(possibly
due
to
menses
exposure).
If
you’re
forced
to
choose
for
FM
/
behavioral
science
Qs,
however ,
still
inform
that
abstinence
or
barrier
contraception
minimizes
risk.
Hepatocellular
damage
is
due
to
T
cells
/
death
is
due
to
T-cell-mediated
apoptosis,
not
direct
viral
cytopathicity .
This
is
the
highest
yield
point
for
HepC
on
USMLE.
No
vaccine
due
to
  
antigenic
variation
(i.e.,
>7
genotypes
and
80
subtypes
of
HepC
exist).
IgM
against
HepC
means
acute
infection.
IgG
against
HepC
means
usually
means
chronic
HepC.
Many
drugs
can
be
used
to
treat.
USMLE
doesn’t
care.
You
could
in
theory
be
aware
of
pegylated

West
Nile
virus
Asked
once
on
an
old,
offline
NBME.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
it
has
a
bird
reservoir
and
is
spread
by
Culex
mosquito.
Presents
as
flu-like
illness
in
most
people.
The
NBME
Q
simply
gives
patient
with
headache
and
fever
+
they
say
the
causal
organism
is
spread
by
Culex
mosquito
and
has
a
bird
reservoir
–>
answer
=
West
Nile
virus.
Dengue
virus
Spread
usually
by
Aedes
mosquito.
Causes
flu-like
illness
+
thrombocytopenia
(bleeding
gums,
petechiae,
etc.)
+
severe
joint
and
abdominal
pain.
Yellow
fever
virus
Spread
usually
by
Aedes
mosquito.

--- Page 179 ---

Causes
flu-like
illness
and
jaundice
(hence
yellow
fever)
due
to
hepatocellular
damage.
Councilman
bodies
are
seen
on
biopsy
of
the
liver,
which
are
apoptotic
bodies.
Zika
virus
Spread
usually
by
Aedes
mosquito.
Causes
microcephaly
in
neonates
if
mother
exposed
while
pregnant.
Human
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus
Retrovirus
similar
to
HIV.
Causes
a
cutaneous
T-cell
lymphoma,
known
as
mycosis
fungoides,
which
appears
like
a
skin
rash.
Mycosis
fungoides
If
this
extends
to
the
blood
as
a
T-cell
leukemia,
it
is
now
called
Sezary
syndrome.
Sezary
syndrome
usually
presents
with
diffusely
red
skin,
called
erythroderma.


--- Page 180 ---

Sezary
syndrome
Both
mycosis
fungoides
and
Sezary
syndrome
are
characterized
by
cerebriform-shaped
cells
on
light
microscopy .
HTLV
can
also
cause
an
obscure
condition
called
tropical
spastic
paraparesis,
which
is
antibodies
against
neuronal
cells
leading
to
otherwise
unexplained
neurodegeneration
over
weeks
to
months.
Hepatitis
D
Requires
hepatitis
B
in
order
to
infect,
which
can
be
due
to
co-infection
(happening
at
the
same
time)
or
superinfection
(occurs
later
in
someone
who
already
has
HepB).
If
USMLE
asks
how
to
prevent
HepD
infection,
answer
=
vaccination
against
hepatitis
B.
There
is
no
vaccine
against
HepD.
Apparently
HepB
antigen
forms
the
envelope
for
HepD
(i.e.,
forms
a
circle
around
HepD).
Human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
Invades
and
destroys
CD4+
T
cells.
Transmitted
via
blood,
IV
drug
use,
and
sexually .
Also
present
in
breastmilk.
Highly
active
anti-retroviral
therapy
(HAAR T)
consists
of
three
drugs:
two
nucleoside
reverse-transcriptase
inhibitors
(NRTI)
+
either
a
non-nucleoside
reverse-transcriptase
inhibitor
(NNR TI)
or
protease
inhibitor .


--- Page 181 ---

Pharmacology
for
HIV
is
lengthy
and
involved,
so
if
you
want
in
depth
discussion
of
all
of
the
drugs,
you
can
open
as
a
separate
tab
my
HIV
pharm
module
here.
HAAR T
therapy
is
initiated
immediately
upon
diagnosis
of
HIV.
We
do
not
wait
for
CD4
count
to
fall
to
a
certain
level
before
commencing.
Once
CD4
count
falls
below
200/μ
L,
patients
are
started
on
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX)
for
Pneumocystis
jiroveci
pneumonia
(PJP)
prophylaxis.
NBME
has
Q
where
they
give
you
an
HIV
patient
with
CD4
count
of,
e.g.,
550,
and
then
ask
what
type
of
drug
regimen
needs
to
be
commenced.
Answer
in
this
case
is
“three
drug
anti-retroviral
therapy
alone,”
where
“three
drug
anti-retroviral
therapy
+
Pneumocystis
prophylaxis”
is
wrong,
as
well
as
all
answers
that
say
two-drug
regimen.
HIV
patients
with
CD4
counts
under
200,
or
those
who
get
any
HIV-related
opportunistic
infection,
are
said
to
have
Acquired
Immunodeficiency
Syndrome
(AIDS).
Toxoplasmosis
comes
in
with
CD4
count
under
100.
Prophylaxis
is
TMP/SMX,
the
same
as
for
PJP,
so
often
times,
once
TMP/SMX
is
appropriately
commenced
at
CD4
of
200
for
PJP,
it’s
already
“two
birds
with
one
stone,”
so
we
don’t
have
to
worry
about
Toxo
prophylaxis
later.
However
the
treatment
for
Toxo
is
sulfadiazine
+
pyrimethamine.
For
Pneumocystis
TMP/SMX
is
both
the
prophylaxis
and
treatment.
NBME
asks
the
Tx
for
toxo
on
one
of
the
forms,
where
TMP/SMX
is
also
listed
and
wrong.
So
you
need
to
know
the
prophylaxes
+
treatments
for
Toxo
and
PJP.
Under
CD4
counts
of
50-100,
Mycobacterium
avium
intracellulare
and
CMV
infections
can
occur .
MAI
causes
lung
infections
similar
to
TB,
and
also
sometimes
GI
infections.
CMV
causes
retinitis.
Blurry
vision
in
an
HIV
patient
is
CMV
retinitis
till
proven
otherwise.
In
addition,
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML;
neuronal
degeneration
caused
by
reactivation
of
JC
polyoma
virus)
,
primary
CNS
lymphoma,
and
AIDS
complex
dementia
(presents
as
wet,
wobbly ,
wacky ,
similar
to
normal
pressure
hydrocephalus)
can
occur
at
CD4
counts
<50-100.

--- Page 182 ---

The
USMLE
might
give
you
a
patient
with
CD4
count
of
47
who
has
ring-enhancing
lesion
of
the
brain
who
is
taking
HAAR T
and
TMP/SMX.
Diagnosis
is
primary
CNS
lymphoma;
Toxo
is
wrong.
The
way
we
know
Toxo
is
wrong
is
because
the
patient
is
on
TMP/SMX,
which
is
the
prophylaxis
for
both
Pneumocystis
and
Toxo.
Commencing
TMP/SMX
at
a
CD4
count
of
200
for
PJP,
as
I
already
said,
is
“two
birds
with
one
stone”
by
the
time
the
patient
gets
to
CD4
of
100,
which
is
when
Toxo
comes
in.
It’s
only
patients
who
aren’t
on
TMP/SMX
by
the
time
they
fall
to
CD4
of
100
who
get
Toxo.
Causes
Cryptococcal
neoformans
meningitis,
which
presents
with
low
glucose,
high
protein,
and
high
lymphocytes.
Diagnosed
with
CSF
latex
agglutination
(most
accurate),
or
India
ink
prep,
or
mucicarmine
staining.
Adults
with
severe
acute-onset
seborrheic
dermatitis,
disseminated
scabies,
or
molloscum
contagiosum
should
have
an
HIV
test.
HIV
increases
risk
of
squamous
cell
carcinoma
in
MSM.
HIV
can
cause
focal
segmental
glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS),
a
nephrotic
syndrome.
When
HIV
leads
to
renal
disease,
it
is
called
HIV
nephropathy .
It
is
almost
always
FSGS.
HIV
can
lead
to
chronic
diarrhea
caused
by
Cryptosporidium
parvum
,
whereas
immunocompetent
patients
clear
it.
C.
parvum
is
a
protozoan
(unicellular
eukaryote).
Can
be
a
cause
of
anemia
of
chronic
disease
(low
Hb,
low
iron,
normal
ferritin).
Patients
with
HIV
require
Pap
smear
at
time
of
diagnosis,
and
then
every
year
(annually)
thereafter
(asked
on
Obgyn
forms).
Normally ,
Paps
are
performed
every
three
years
from
age
21,
and
then
every
5
years
from
age
30
with
HPV
co-testing.
To
prevent
vertical
transmission,
the
most
important
measure
to
take
is
HAAR T
therapy
while
pregnant
+
keeping
the
mother ’s
viral
load
as
low
as
possible.
She
will
then
receive
intrapartum
zidovudine,
C-section
is
performed,
and
then
the
neonate
will
receive
6
weeks
of
zidovudine
commenced
within
12
hours
of
birth.
Some
students
will
get
pedantic
about
various
alternative/updated
regimens
for
neonates,
but
one
of
the
NBMEs
assesses
this
point
about
6
weeks
of
zidovudine
commenced
within
12
hours
of
birth.

Coronavirus
The
virus
specifically
known
as
SARS-CoV -2,
or
COVID-19,
caused
the
2019
global
pandemic.

--- Page 185 ---

SARS
stands
for
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome.
The
pandemic
is
believed
to
have
started
following
a
laboratory
leak
in
Wuhan,
China,
although
this
has
been
a
source
of
political
debate,
where
initial
explanations
asserted
that
there
was
a
natural,
zoonotic
origin
for
the
virus
(i.e.,
originating
from
animals,
e.g.,
bats).
Has
characteristic
spike
proteins
that
create
a
crown-like
appearance
on
electron
microscopy .
The
spike
proteins
bind
to
ACE2
receptor ,
allowing
for
viral
fusion
with
host
respiratory
epithelium.
Presentation
can
range
from
mild
respiratory
symptoms
similar
to
the
common
cold
(rhinovirus)
all
the
way
to
severe
respiratory
disease
with
multi-organ
failure.
Many
different
vaccine
types
exist
–
i.e.,
mRNA
(Moderna;
delivers
mRNA
coding
for
the
spike
protein),
viral
vector
(AstraZeneca;
delivers
mRNA
in
a
harmless
viral
capsid),
and
killed
(Sinovac;
delivers
inactivated,
killed
virus).
Both
live
viral
infection
as
well
as
vaccination
are
known
to
cause
rare
adverse
effects,
such
as
Bell’s
palsy
and
myocarditis,
although
these
effects
are
not
unique
to
coronavirus
and
can
rarely
happen
with
many
viral
infections
and
vaccines.
Vaccination
mandates
and
their
political
implications
were
(and
still
are)
a
source
of
contentious
debate.
Prior
to
the
2019
pandemic,
coronavirus
was
known
to
cause
SARS
in
China
in
2002
and
Middle
Eastern
Respiratory
Syndrome
(MERS)
in
Saudi
Arabia
in
2012.
Vaccination
schedule
for
children
now
recommends
IM
vaccine
starting
at
6
months;
2-3-doses.
Hantavirus
Causes
pulmonary
syndrome
and
hemorrhagic
fever .
Spread
by
rodents/mice.

--- Page 186 ---

This
virus
is
known
to
get
rarely
asked
on
Step
1,
where
they
apparently
mention
hantavirus
in
the
vignette
in
a
patient
with
a
fatal
hemorrhagic
pulmonary
syndrome,
and
then
the
answer
is
just
“mice”
for
how
it’s
acquired.
Influenza
Causes
respiratory
distress,
fever ,
and
myalgias
(muscle
pain).
For
USMLE
purposes,
the
myalgias
are
exceedingly
HY
as
a
vignette
finding
that
usually
suggests
the
flu
over
other
diagnoses.
Has
8
segments,
two
of
which
are
hemagglutinin
and
neuraminidase.
Hemagglutinin
mediates
viral
attachment
to
the
cell
by
enabling
its
binding
at
sialic
acid
receptors.
If
a
question
asks
about
the
molecule
most
flu
vaccines
are
targeted
against,
the
answer
is
hemagglutinin.
Neuraminidase
allows
for
newly
synthesized
viral
particles
to
leave
the
host
cell.
This
enzyme
cleaves
sialic
acid
residues,
which
normally
bind
the
new
viral
particles
within
the
cell.
Once
these
residues
are
cleaved,
the
viral
particles
can
leave
the
cell.
Drugs
such
as
oseltamivir
and
zanamivir
are
sialic
acid
analogues
that
function
as
neuraminidase
competitive
inhibitors.
In
other
words,
they
prevent
the
virus
from
leaving
the
cell.
If
the
USMLE
asks
which
drug
prevents
viral
spread
within
a
community ,
or
they
tell
you
a
drug
is
given
and
now
host
cells
are
“packed
with
virions”
(because
they
can’t
leave
the
cell),
the
answer
is
one
of
the
-mivirs.
Antigenic
drift
is
point
mutations
in
hemagglutinin
and/or
neuraminidase,
where
the
virus
has
changed
slightly .
It
leads
to
seasonal
epidemics.
Antigenic
shift
is
due
to
two
influenza
viruses
entering
a
cell,
one
of
human
origin,
the
other
of
animal
origin
(such
as
bird
or
swine),
where
they
engage
in
reassortment
of
viral
segments,
leading
to
a
completely
novel
influenza
virus.
It
leads
to
generational
pandemics.
If
a
patient
gets
a
bacterial
lobar
pneumonia
following
recent
convalescence
from
influenza
infection,
USMLE
likes
S.
aureus
as
a
HY
cause.
The
USMLE
will
not
play
trivia
where
they
list
S.
aureus
alongside
S.
pneumo
and
you’re
forced
to
choose.
What

--- Page 187 ---

they’ll
do
is
say
something
about
how
a
guy
recently
recovered
from
a
viral
illness
in
which
he
had
high
fever
and
myalgias,
and
now
he
has
a
pneumonia
caused
by
a
gram-positive
coccus
in
clusters
–>
answer
=
S.
aureus
.
In
contrast,
S.
pneumo
is
gram-positive
diplococci.
Vaccine
is
given
fall
or
winter
every
year.
USMLE
really
cares
about
this.
So
much
so,
they
will
sometimes
say
“April”
in
a
vignette,
where
giving
flu
vaccine
is
wrong,
or
they’ll
say
“January”
or
“October ,”
where
giving
it
is
correct.
IM
killed
vaccine:
start
age
6
months,
then
give
yearly
throughout
life;
safe
to
give
during
pregnancy .
Intranasal
live-attenuated
vaccine:
ages
2-45;
immunocompetent,
non-pregnant
persons
only.
Parainfluenza
virus
Aka
paramyxovirus.
Causes
laryngotracheobronchitis
(croup).
Presents
as
hoarse,
barking,
or
seal-like
cough
in
school-age
kid.
The
Q
can
say
the
cough
gets
better
when
his
dad
brings
him
out
into
the
cold
air.
Neck
x-ray
shows
“steeple
sign,”
which
is
sub-glottic
narrowing.


--- Page 188 ---

Don’t
confuse
the
steeple
sign
of
croup
with
the
thumbprint
sign
of
epiglottitis
caused
by
H.
influenzae
type
B.
Sometimes
the
Q
can
give
you
easy
vignette
of
croup,
but
then
the
answer
is
just
“larynx”
(literally
inflammation
of
the
larynx,
trachea,
and
the
bronchi).
“Sub-glottic”
means
below
the
area
of
the
vocal
cords.
The
larynx
is
the
area
encompassing
the
vocal
cords.
Tx
is
supportive.
If
they
force
you
to
choose
an
actual
Tx,
however ,
nebulized
racemic
epinephrine
is
the
answer .
Respiratory
syncytial
virus
(RSV)
Answer
on
USMLE
for
a
kid
<18
months
old
who
has
low-grade
fever
and
bilateral
wheezes.
Tx
is
supportive
care
on
USMLE.
Don’t
choose
answers
like
ribavirin
or
palivizumab.
Mumps
Causes
POM
–>
Parotitis,
Orchitis,
Meningitis.
Doesn’t
typically
cause
rash.
Vaccine
is
MMR,
which
is
live-attenuated.
Measles
Aka
rubeola;
causes
a
head-to-toe
macular
popular
rash.


--- Page 189 ---

The
notion
of
“cough,
coryza,
conjunctivitis”
as
=
measles
is
absolute
garbage
and
a
flaming
joke.
No
idea
why
there
have
been
resources
over
the
years
that
have
perpetuated
this
trash.
These
symptoms
are
non-specific
for
viral
infections
in
general
(e.g.,
rhinovirus,
RSV,
etc.).
I
frequently
see
students
get
easy
NBME
Qs
wrong
where
they
think
measles
is
the
diagnosis
in
the
setting
of
these
symptoms.
Can
cause
Koplik
spots
(pathognomonic
whiteish
lesions
on
buccal
mucosa).
MMR
vaccine
is
live-attenuated;
contraindicated
in
pregnancy;
not
contraindicated
in
HIV.
Immigrant
Hx
on
USMLE
sometimes
implies
unvaccinated
status.
Can
rarely
cause
subacute
sclerosing
panencephalitis
(reactivation
of
latent
infection
in
the
CNS
in
teenagers).
Rubella
also
causes
a
head-to-toe
macular
popular
rash,
but
rather
than
Koplik
spots,
suboccipital
and
post-auricular
lymphadenopathy
(tenderness
on
back
of
head
and
behind
ears)
is
characteristic.
Rabies
Causes
encephalomyelitis
that
is
nearly
always
fatal.


--- Page 190 ---

Spread
by
the
bite
or
scratch
of
infected
animals,
such
as
bats,
skunks,
raccoons,
and
wild
dogs.
Travels
up
peripheral
nerves
to
the
CNS.
Has
very
long
incubation
period
of
>1-3
months
before
symptoms
appear .
Presents
as
flu-like
illness
that
progresses
to
neurologic
features,
as
well
as
pathognomonic
findings
such
as
hydrophobia
(fear
of
water),
aerophobia
(fear
of
drafts
of
air),
and
hyper-salivation.
Negri
bodies
are
characteristic
inclusions
seen
on
electron
microscopy
of
infected
neurons.
Ebola
Causes
hemorrhagic
disease,
where
patient
initially
has
flu-like
illness,
followed
by
development
of
internal
and
external
bleeding,
leading
to
death
nearly
always.
Bats
are
the
most
likely
reservoir ,
with
human-human
spread
occurring
via
contact
with
bodily
fluids
(i.e.,
blood,
vomitus,
feces,
sweat).
As

Spirochetes
are
a
group
of
bacteria
with
a
corkscrew-
or
question
mark-shape
that
are
visualized
using
a
method
called
dark-field
microscopy .
You
don’t
need
to
know
the
following
for
USMLE,
but
I
will
clarify
for
some
students
who
ask:
even
though
H.
pylori
also
has
spiral-shape
similar
to
spirochetes,
it
is
not
a
spirochete.
Apparently ,
spirochetes
are
unique
in
that
they
use
axial
filaments
or
endoflagella
for
movement,
whereas
other
bacteria
use
“regular
flagella.”
Treponema
pallidum

--- Page 194 ---

Causes
syphilis.
Spirochete
(spiral/cork
screw-shaped
bacterium)
visible
under
dark-field
microscopy .
Primary
syphilis
=
painless
chancre
(painless
ulcer)
on

Don’t
confuse
the
painless
chancre
of
primary
syphilis
with
chancroid,
which
is
a
painful
chancre-appearing
lesion
(-oid
means
“looks
like
but
ain’t”)
caused
by
the
bacterium
Haemophilus
ducreyi
.
Secondary
syphilis
=
6
weeks
to
6
months
after
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
initial
chancre,
patient
can
get
body
rash
that
includes
palms
+
soles,
and
condylomata
lata
(painless
genital
plaques).
Don’t
confuse
condylomata
lata
with
condylomata
acuminata
(genital
warts).
Tertiary
syphilis
=
years
later,
patient
can
get
gummas
(appear
as
painless
chancres
but
are
on
other
areas
of
the

“stroke
without
hypertension”
(i.e.,
sometimes
findings
akin
to
stroke
but
in
a
younger
patient).
Diagnosis
of
primary
syphilis
is
made
via
visualizing
the
spirochetes
from
a
chancre
scraping
under
dark-field
microscopy .
Diagnosis
of
secondary ,
tertiary ,
and
neurosyphilis
can
be
done
with
serology ,
where
a
VDRL
and/or
RPR
is
done
first
(sensitive
but
not
specific);
an
FTA
is
done
as
confirmatory
(specific
but
not
sensitive).
VDRL
test
mixes
the
patient’ s
serum
with
cardiolipin
antigen.
If
antibodies
against
T.
pallidum
are
present,
the
test
demonstrates
clumping/flocculation.
The
RPR
enhances
this
reaction
by
using
charcoal
particles.
There
is
an
NBME
Q
floating
around
where

--- Page 195 ---

they
say
something
about
a
patient
whose
test
results
demonstrate
clumping
with
charcoal
particles,
and
the
answer
is
SLE.
Patients
with
SLE
who
have
anti-phospholipid
syndrome
can
get
false-positive
VDRL/RPR
tests
because
this
syndrome
is
often
caused
by
antibodies
against
cardiolipin
(in
SLE,
we
simply
call
these
antibodies
“lupus
anticoagulant”).
FTA
mixes
a
patient’ s
serum
with
fluorescent
Treponema
antibodies.
If
binding
occurs,
this
confirms
the
diagnosis
of
syphilis.
USMLE
will
show
you
24-year-old
male
with
rash
on
his
back
+
KOH
prep
is
negative
+
ask
what’ s
most
likely
to
diagnose–>
answer
=
FTA.
Treatment
for
all
syphilis
types
is
penicillin.
If
patient
has
Hx
of
anaphylaxis
to
beta-lactams
but
is
pregnant
or
has
tertiary
or
neurosyphilis,
the
answer
is
desensitize
+
give
penicillin.
This
is
because
penicillin
is
the
most
efficacious
and
needs
to
be
given
in
severe
cases.
If
patient
has
Hx
of
mere
rash
to
beta-lactams,
but
not
anaphylaxis,
then
the
beta-lactam
can
be
given
anyway .
Killing
of
T.
pallidum
spirochetes
can
sometimes
cause
a
hypersensitivity-type
response
by
the
immune
system
known
as
Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction.
USMLE
will
say
patient
was
given
penicillin
for
syphilis
+
gets
fever ,
chills,
and
myalgias.
This
is
different
from
beta-lactam
allergy ,
which
would
be
a
rash
or
anaphylaxis
(swelling
+
low
BP).
Congenital
syphilis
can
cause
tooth
abnormalities
(mulberry
molars/incisors),
“saber
shins”
(bone
abnormalities),
saddle
nose,
deafness,
and
cataracts.
There
is
NBME
Q
floating
around
where
they
are
vague
+
give
basically
no
info
apart
from
“tooth
abnormalities,”
where
the
answer
is
congenital
syphilis.
So
this
finding
is
especially
important
for
USMLE.
Borellia
burgdorferi
Spirochete;
spiral/corkscrew-shaped.
Causes
lyme
disease;
spread
by
Ixodes
tick
(same
as
Ehrlichia,
Babesia
,
and
Anaplasma
).

--- Page 196 ---

Primary
Lyme
causes
a
classic
target
rash
known
as
erythema
chronicum
migrans,
but
a
HY
point
is
that
the
rash
need
not
be
a
target
on
USMLE.
It
can
merely
be
circular
with
no
clearing,
but
the
target
is
classic.
Bells
palsy
can
also
be
seen
in
primary
Lyme.
What
the
USMLE
will
do
is
give
two
side
by
side
images:
1)
circular
rash
on
limb
that
is
not
a
target;
2)
Bells
palsy ,
where
the
student
needs
to
infer
this
is
Lyme
disease
even
though
rash
isn’t
a
target,
since
Bells
palsy
is
HY
for
Lyme.
Secondary
Lyme
tends
to
cause
arthritis.
Some
sources
say
Bell’s
palsy
is
part
of
secondary
Lyme
(occurs
at
least
one
month
after
initial
infection),
but
I’ve
seen
USMLE
give
it
as
part
of
initial/primary
infection.
Tertiary
Lyme
can
cause
CNS
and/or
heart
problems.
Treatment
is
doxycycline
for
most
cases
of
Lyme.
Ceftriaxone
is
given
for
advanced
Lyme
involving
the
CNS
or
heart.
For
children
<8
and
pregnant
women,
give
amoxicillin
in
place
of
doxycyline.
There
is
an
NBME
Q
of
a
pregnant
woman
with
non-disseminated
Lyme,
where
ceftriaxone
is
correct
over
doxycycline,
and
amoxicillin
isn’t
listed.
In
other
words,
if
USMLE
doesn’t
want
doxy
as
the
answer ,
they
will
not
play
trivia
as
to
whether
it’s
ceftriaxone
or
amoxicillin
to
be
used
as
the
alternative.
But
you
could
be
aware
that,
in
theory ,
ceftriaxone
is
harder-hitting
and
preferred
if
cases
are
more
severe.
Borellia
recurrentis
Causes
a
condition
known
as
relapsing
fever .
Spread
by
body
lice,
not
Ixodes
tick
the
way
Lyme
disease
is.
Leptospira
interrogans
Question
mark-shaped
spirochete.

--- Page 197 ---

Leptospirosis
can
present
as
flu-like
illness,
jaundice,
pulmonary
hemorrhage,
and
meningoencephalitis.
It
is
usually
spread
by
animal
urine.
There’ s
two
ways
USMLE
asks
Leptospira
:
1)
They’ll
be
hyper-obvious
and
say
there’ s
a
farmer
with
a
weird,
flu-like
illness
where
he
was
walking
in
animal
urine.
Answer
is
just
simply
Leptospira
.
2)
They’ll
give
easy
vignette
of
syphilis
or
Lyme
disease,
followed
by
asking
which
of
the
following
organisms
is
most
taxonomically
similar
(i.e.,
which
of
the
following
is
also
a
spirochete),
and
the
answer
is
just
Leptospira
.
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
Has
unique
cell
wall
composed
of
mycolic
acid
that
is
difficult
to
gram
stain.
Requires
acid-fast
stain.
Produces
cord
factor
(asked
on
NBME)
as
a
virulence
factor .
Can
present
similar
to
lung
cancer ,
where
patient
can
have
B
symptoms
(i.e.,
fever ,
night
sweats,
weight
loss)
and
hemoptysis.
Living
in
a
homeless
shelter
or
immigrant
status
from
endemic
area
is
buzzy .
I’ve
seen
rural
India
and
Albania
as
two
locations
in
NBME
Qs.
Prisoners/prison
workers,
healthcare
workers,
and
TB
laboratory
personnel
are
of
course
at
risk
as
well.
Can
cause
cavitations
and
calcification
in
the
lung
grossly;
on
histo,
causes
caseating
granulomatous
inflammation.
Ghon
foci/complexes
are
textbook
descriptors
for
TB
lesions
but
not
assessed
eponymously
on
USMLE.
A
Ghon
focus
is
a
localized
area
of
inflammation.
If
lymph
nodes
are
involved,
the
combination
of
the
lesion
+
lymph
node(s)
is
called
a
Ghon
complex.
Can
cause
constrictive
pericarditis
(can
also
calcify).

--- Page 198 ---

Disseminated
TB
(miliary
TB)
can
affect
multiple
organ
systems,
leading
to
psoas
abscess,
Pott
disease
(TB
infection
of
the
vertebrae),
adrenal
insuf ficiency ,
meningitis,
osteomyelitis,
and
arthritis.
First
step
in
diagnosis
is
PPD
test
(type
IV
hypersensitivity).
If
PPD
test
is
(+),
the
next
best
step
is
CXR.
If
PPD
is
(+)
but
CXR
(-),
next
best
step
is
“treat
for
latent
TB,
“
or
“give
TB
prophylaxis.”
This
is
isoniazid
(INH)
for
9
months
+
vitamin
B6
(since
INH
can
cause
B6
deficiency).
It
is
exceedingly
HY
you
know
that
neuropathy
in
a
patient
being
treated
for
TB
has
B6
deficiency .
If
PPD
and
CXR
are
both
(+),
the
next
best
step
is
“treat
for
active
TB,”
which
is
RIPE
for
2
months
+
RI
for
4
more
months
(6
months
total).
RIPE
=
rifampin,
isoniazid,
pyrazinamide,
ethambutol.
BCG
vaccine
is
live-attenuated.
USMLE
wants
you
to
know
Hx
of
BCG
vaccine
does
not
change
management
based
on
PPD
guidelines.
If
USMLE
asks
you
how
long
after
TB
exposure
will
someone’ s
sputum
cultures
be
positive,
the
answer
is
2-5
weeks.
Interferon-gamma
release
assay
(Quantiferon
Gold)
can
be
used
in
patients
who
have
Hx
of
BCG
to
reduce
false
(+)s,
but
USMLE
doesn’t
assess
it.
The
reason
I
mention
it
is
because
they
want
you
to
know
interferon-gamma
is
required
for
stimulation
of
alveolar
macrophages
to
control
TB.
Patients
who
have
IFN-gamma
or
IL-12
receptor
deficiency
have
 
susceptibility
to
TB
infections.
If
this
immuno
stuff
sounds
confusing,
I
talk
about
this
in
detail
in
my
HY
Immuno
PDF.
TNF-alpha
is
also
required
to
suppress
TB.
Therefore
drugs
such
as
infliximab,
adalimumab,
and
etanercept
 increase
risk
of
TB,
which
is
why
they
should
be
avoided
in
silicosis
patients
(who
have
increased
risk
of
TB).
What
is
considered
a
positive
PPD
test
(in
terms
of
#
of
mm
of
induration)
differs
depending
on
risk
factors:

--- Page 199 ---

What
is
considered
a
positive
PPD
test
(in
terms
of
#
of
mm
of
induration)
differs
depending
on
risk
factors:
>5mm
(+):
Hx
of
close
contact
to
someone
with
active
TB;
immunocompromised
patient
(AIDS,
organ
transplant
recipient
receiving
immunosuppressants,
chronic
corticosteroid
user);
calcification
on
CXR.
>10mm
(+):
Health
care
worker
or
prisoner/prison
worker;
immigrant
from
endemic
area;
TB
laboratory
personnel,
children
<4.
>15mm
(+):
everyone
else.
If
a
PPD
test
is
(+),
never
repeat
it.
If
it
is
negative,
it
must
be
repeated
in
1-2
weeks
(i.e.,
sometimes
false-negatives).
Rifampin
is
a
DNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase
(just
remember
“RDR”
–>
Rifampin
DNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase).
It
can
cause
orange
tears/secretions.
It
also
upregulates
P-450.
Isoniazide
is
a
mycolic
acid
synthesis
inhibitor .
It
can
cause
B6
deficiency
(neuropathy
and/or
seizures)
and
high
anion-gap
metabolic
acidosis
(the
I
in
MUDPILES
refers
to
isoniazid/iron
tablets).
It
also
inhibits
P-450.
Pyrazinamide
inhibits
fatty
acid
synthesis.
Ethambutol
inhibits
carbohydrate
synthesis
(arabinosyl
transferase).
It
causes
optic
neuritis,
sometimes
with
changes
in
color
vision.
Mycobacterium
leprae
Causes
leprosy;
affects
skin
and
peripheral
nerves.
Highest
yield
point
for
USMLE
is
that
M.
leprae
grows
best
at
cooler
temperatures,
which
is
why
it
affects
areas
like
the
nose
and
peripheral
nerves.
Shows
up
on
an
NBME
Q
where
they
ask
what
is
most
characteristic
of
the
causal
organism,
and
the
answer
is
something
like
“temperature
sensitive.”
Dapsone
is
used
as
part
of
the
treatment.
It’s
HY
to
know
it
can
cause
hemolysis
in
G6PD.

--- Page 200 ---

Mycobacterium
avium
intracellulare
MAI
can
cause
lung
infections
similar
in
presentation
to
TB;
can
also
cause
GI
infections.
These
types
of
infections
are
classically
seen
in
immunocompromised
patients
(i.e.,
AIDS
with
CD4
count
<50).
Azithromycin
prophylaxis
is
no
longer
indicated
for
AIDS
patients.
MAI
can
also
cause
an
obscure
pneumonitis
called
“hot
tub
lung,”
which
can
occur
in
immunocompetent
patients.
Shows
up
on
an
NBME
exam
as
guy
who
moved
into
new
apartment
building
with
a
hot
tub.
MAI
present
in
hot
tub
vapors
can
cause
lung
inflammation
(hence
pneumonitis).
Mycobacterium
marinum
Causes
red
lesion(s)
on
finger/hand
in
workers
at,
or
kids
who
go
to,
water
parks/aquariums.
USMLE
will
give
Pseudomonas
and
S.
aureus
as
distractors.
So
be
aware
of
M.
marinum
as
buzzy
cause
of
skin
infection
associated
with
water
parks
and
aquariums.
Mycobacterium
scrofulaceum
Causes
lymphadenopathy
in
the
neck,
sometimes
with
a
skin
lesion.
Not
HY,
but
you
can
be
aware
it
exists.
